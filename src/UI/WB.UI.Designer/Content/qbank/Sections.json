In this context, the short health module does four things. First, it collects some cursory information on the health status of  household members. Second, it gathers information on all outpatient visits to health facilities by household members during the previous four weeks and on all inpatient visits in the previous 12 months. This information on utilization can be used to perform relatively simple analyses of the incidence of public health spending among different population groups. \n\nThird, the short module collects some information on the household's expenditures on visits to the different providers.This provides a more accurate measure of the household's total expenditures on health than would be obtained by asking a single general question about these expenditures in the consumption module. This expenditure information also gives analysts a rough idea of the out-of-pocket cost of obtaining health care by type of service provider. (If more detailed expenditure data are required, the standard module should be used.) Fourth, the short module gathers very brief information on insurance coverage-just enough to indicate who is covered by insurance and who is not.\n\nEven this short version of the health module may seem quite long. It contains 39 questions, about twice as many as were used in the health modules of the first LSMS surveys in the mid to late 1980s. However, the health information gathered in those first LSMS surveys was of very limited use. Moreover, when the short module presented here is administered, most respondents will be asked far fewer than 39 questions, since most probably will not have visited a health care provider in the previous four weeks. The field test should verify that the time required to fill out the short health module in a typical household is 10-15 minutes. \n\nA final point regarding the short module is that there is no need to administer a health facility questionnaire as well.

It has been kept quite short in the hope that this will increase the probability of respondents giving a complete account of the work they did during the previous 7 days. If, however, survey designers plan on asking only a few more detailed questions about 7-day reference period jobs, and if they are willing to ask those questions about all work activities in the reference period (rather than just the two most important ones), the questions could be added to this section and Part C could be eliminated. \n\nPart B also determines which occupations were the most important in the past 12 months.

Second, it is useful to keep the overview section short so that a complete accounting of activities may be recorded before respondents become weary of a long list of question. Finally, the focus in the overview is on occupations, while the focus in the detailed questions is on the main job within each occupation. Similar points can be made about splitting questions about the 12-month reference period in Parts B and D.\n\nRespondents are asked to report on any permanent jobs they may have held during the previous 7 days even when they actually did no work during that time.

", "quality_control":"", "notes":"LIST OF ITEMS: The list of items that should be included in this submodule will vary from country to country. Special care should be taken to itemize goods that contribute substantially to the total number of calories consumed and to expenditures, as well as goods that are (or are most likely to be) subsidized. To prevent the list of items from becoming unwieldy (in the order of hundreds), there will have to be some grouping of items, using categories such as\n\"canned foods\" or \"vegetables.\" These groupings, while necessary, can pose problems for interviewers in eliciting answers about quantities of the item consumed and for analysts in trying to establish the nutrient content of the items. There is no perfect solution to this problem. For some items it may be pragmatic to black out the quantities question, thereby eliminating a source of confusion in the interview at the small cost of losing a piece of ambiguous data. For other items, taking care to keep the subgrouping reasonably homogenous may help resolve the issues of establishing quantities and estimating caloric content. \"Leafy green vegetables\" and \"potatoes, sweet potatoes, and other tubers\" are more internally homogenous categories than \"vegetables.\" Whether or not they adopt these approaches, survey designers need to bear the  problems of grouping in mind.\n\nIt is usual, and probably helps respondents remember the necessary information, to list similar items together. In past surveys this has usually meant placing botanically similar items side by side-in other one words, all meats together and all fruits and vegetables together-and, within each group, placing first the items that are more commonly consumed. Such placement probably reflects people's shopping patterns in most countries; vegetables may be in one section of the market and meats in another, or people may buy their vegetables from the greengrocer and their meat from the butcher. If a very long list of items is used, it might make the interview more manageable to divide the list into subgroups in a more explicit way than is shown in the draft submodule, with subheadings for each subgroup. Then each subgroup could have a filter question such as \"did your household purchase any meat since my last visit?\" After that, separate questions on each kind of meat would follow. Some surveys supplement this general filter question by showing the respondent a card that either lists or illustrates (depending on the degree of literacy in the country) the various items in the subcategory as a prompt.\n\nRECALL PERIODS: The recall period used in this submodule is the time since the interviewer's last visit to the household. Questions in the food submodule presume that the interviewer's last visit to the household was about two weeks before the interview on consumption; this was generally the case in the old prototypical fieldwork plan where each primary sampling unit was visited by the survey teams twice, two weeks apart, and different sections of the questionnaire were administered in each visit.\nIn single-visit scenarios the recall question (Question 2) should be changed from \"since my last visit\" to \"in the past two weeks.\" In countries with high inflation rates or where other expenditure surveys use a shorter reference period, survey designers may shorten the recall period to a week or to whatever period matches that of the other survey.\n\nBARTER: If barter is common in the country of the survey, it can be included in the wording of the purchase question (Question 5). If barter is very important, survey designers may wish to give it a question of its own. It will be particularly important to pilot-test the wording of the purchase question as this can often be awkward.\n\nQUANTITY: The quantity question (Question 4) applies to the short recall period question, so that when a unit value is derived from this data, it refers to a specific time period. To have a unit value (quasi price) for some indeterminate month during the year is not very helpful where there is even modest inflation or seasonal variation in prices.\n\nFUEL: Fuel is placed in the same submodule as food because it is the main category of nonfood that is purchased in convenient, standard units. This follows the principle that wherever quantities can be collected easily and accurately, they should be. Hence it is convenient, though not usual, to put fuel in the food submodule so that the follow-on questions on quantities will apply.\n\nHoME PRODUCTION. There are several options about how to arrange the questions on home prodtiction (Questions 7-9). The option most commonly used in previous LSMS surveys has been to place these quetions either together with food purchases, as is done here, or in a separate submodule on home production. Occasionally the consumption of home-produced food has appeared in the agricultural module as part of the means by which a crop is disposed of.  \n\nWhether the questions on households' consumption of home-produced food should be placed adjacent to the questions on their purchases of food or in a separate submodule is an issue that will be affected by both the percentage of households that produce their own food and the range of goods produced in this way. If questions on home-produced goods are placed in a separate submodule, it is simple to add the filter question, \"Has your household consumed any food produced at home?\" Then it is possible to avoid asking a long list of inapplicable questions to households that do not produce any food at home. This will be most appropriate when home production is not very common. Ultimately, what works best should be determined by the field test. Do respondents find it easier to think about all of the sources of a single foodstuff together? (For example, I bought some tomatoes, I grew some tomatoes in my garden, or my coworker gave me some tomatoes?) Or is it easier for them to think about their food budget in terms of the source of that food? (For example, when I shop I buy beans, tortillas and milk, but in my garden I grow tomatoes, papaya, and bananas.) The decision about whether to put these questions in a separate submodule will not materially affect the length of the interview, although separating home production from purchased food may take up more paper and make the questionnaire physically longer. \n\nIt is not necessary to have a home production question for every food item in the list, since some are industrially manufactured items that cannot be made in people's homes. Even some items that are not industrially manufactured are not commonly produced in people's homes and can likewise be omitted from the list of home-produced items. In the draft of the submodule, the boxes are blacked out in the home-production columns for items that are unlikely to be produced at home. \n\nThe quantities of food produced at home should be regarded as the most important data gathered about home food production.The quantity of a good is a factual, observable piece of information. Questions about value are more hypothetical, since by definition a home-produced item does not pass through the market. Theoretically, a farmgate price would be too low and a market price too high. There seems to be no evidence as to which price the consumer of home-produced food is likely to know more often or which answer he or she would give in response to a general question on the \"value of home production.\" The draft submodule includes a general (ill-defined) question on the \"value of home production\" on the grounds that-for goods that have markets-the food purchases questions, community questionnaire, or both gather information on prices or unit values from food purchases and may gather data on farmgate prices in the agricultural module (if there is one). Thus the \"value of home production\" contributes a different set of information, at least on the aspect that the respondent feels is most pertinent.\n\nGIFTS: In some past LSMS surveys, the gifts section included the value of food received as payment in kind from employers. This is not included in this draft subdmodule, because it already appears in the various employment submodules. \n\nUSE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY PROVIDED GOODS: If survey designers wish to try to put an explicit value on the use of all environmentally provided resources, the list of food items should include any food items that are likely to be gathered, fished, or hunted. In addition, the wording for the questions may be changed or additional questions may be added to clarify that environmentally provided items are included in the questioning.

With these issues in mind, they can decide which of the credit parts and questions can be dropped and which must remain. For most general analysis, basic information is needed on use of credit, access to credit, and ownership of collateral. If the survey is intended to evaluate a specific policy, appropriate questions may be added.\n\nUSE OF CREDIT: The use of credit could be covered in a substantially reduced credit module that includes Part A and some of Part B of the standard version of the credit module. Even in the shortened version this module must be administered at the individual level, not the household level. A series of 24 questions may be used to determine the number of loans that the respondent has received in the past 12 months as well as some key details about his or her most recent loan. This will allow the analyst to determine the individual's total debt, but it will not provide data on the cost of obtaining or repaying a loan, nor will it provide data on the total inflow or outflow associated with credit use in any given time period. To be sure to capture all credit use, additional questions about the use of credit should be included in the consumption, agriculture, and household enterprise modules. The series of questions about supplier credit and purchases \"on credit\" can be reduced to a simple \"Yes/No\" question in each module, phrased as follows: \"Did you, or anyone in your household, purchase any food (agricultural supplies/businesses inputs) on credit during the past 12 months?\"\n\nHowever, it is important to keep in mind that these questions are included in these modules for specific analytical purposes not related to the analysis of credit. Thus survey designers should consult the analytical objectives of the other modules before deciding to delete these questions.\n\nACCESS TO CREDIT: The questions that determine individuals' use of credit also yield a great deal of information about their access to credit. Additional questions that reveal credit access are in Part C of the standard credit module, on credit history; most of Part C incorporated into the short version of the module. These questions are not controversial and can be answered quickly.\n\nCOLLATERAL: As discussed above, the questions on collateral are placed in the housing, agriculture, and household enterprise modules. To shorten the questionnaire these questions can be simplified to \"Who owns the asset?\" and \"What form of title does this person hold?\" The type of title is just as important as who owns the asset, so the latter question should not be dropped.

However, there are several drawbacks to including this part (which explain why it is considered optional here). The most compelling argument for not including this module is that given the sample size of LSMS-type so few people may be identified that it may not be worthwhile to try to collect this information.\n\nAnother argument against including Part D is that it touches on what may be a very sensitive area. Even though every attempt has been made to make the part as unthreatening as possible to the lender, including such a part may not be possible in certain countries. If there is a great deal of negative press or bad feeling about informal lenders, lenders may not wish to tell interviewers about their lending operations. In such cases it is best to leave out this part to avoid the risk of obtaining poor-quality data and the risk of interviewees refusing to collaborate with the remainder of the survey. \n\nIf Part D is included, it is important to minimize the extent to which respondents feel uncomfortable with this part. This is done in the Part D of the draft credit module. The respondent is never referred to as a lender, nor is the respondent asked about his or her lending activities. Instead the questions refer to who \"owes you money\" or \"who borrowed from you.\" No questions are asked on interest rates charged and other sensitive terms of lending.And the part has deliberately been kept quite short. \n\nIf Part D is omitted analysts have to rely on the detailed loan data from Part B for information on how the informal market works. If survey designers decide to omit Part D, they may wish to gather additional information about informal lenders in Part B, such as names and occupations. After Question 2 in Part B, a new Question 3 should ask: \"What is the main occupation of this person [the lender]?\" The question can be coded with the occupational categories used in the employment module.\n\nThe respondents for this part are all people of working age (with no upper age limit) regardless of whether they borrowed in the 12 months prior to the interview.

Specific response categories under each major heading may be as detailed as necessary for each survey.\n\nDwelling Characteristics and Household Possessions (107\u2013118)\n\nQuestions about whether the household has electricity, a radio, a television, a telephone, a refrigerator, a bicycle, a motorcycle, and a car or a truck are included primarily to provide additional components of the wealth index. The main materials that constitute the floor and roof, as well as the type of cooking fuel used, are additional components of the index. Such information is thought to be reported more reliably and thus to be more useful than a simple question on household income.\n\nIndoor Residual Spraying (IRS) (119\u2013120)\n\nThese questions should be retained in the questionnaire only for countries that implement IRS programs. The questions focus on spraying of the interior walls that took place in the 12 months preceding the survey. The question on who sprayed the house is included to determine whether the spraying was done as part of a government program or through a private entity.\n\nOwnership and Use of Mosquito Nets (121\u2013130)\n\nQuestions 121 to 130 are designed to capture information about the ownership of mosquito nets, whether the nets are treated with insecticides, and the use of the mosquito nets by members of the population. Ascertainment of a full roster of nets in the household has been useful in determining if households have enough nets to protect all household members and if available nets are used by household members. The use of nets by specific target groups of the population can also be examined, for example, children under age 5 and pregnant women who stayed in the household the night preceding the interview.\n\nUse of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) decreases malaria-related morbidity and mortality, especially in vulnerable groups such as children under age 5 and pregnant women. ITNs provide protection both to the individuals sleeping under them by deterring mosquito bites and to other community members by killing mosquitoes, thereby reducing transmission of malaria parasites. For pregnant women, ITNs have been shown to be efficacious in reducing maternal anemia, placental infection, and low infant birth weight. For young children, ITN use is associated with a reduction of anemia, lower infant and child mortality, and fewer episodes of uncomplicated malaria.\n\nITNs are simple, safe, and cost-effective. A net treated with insecticide is effective in repelling or killing mosquitoes before they have the chance to bite. Two types of ITNs can be obtained: long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs), and conventional ITNs. LLINs are ready-to-use nets that are pretreated at a factory and require no further treatment for 3\u20135 years. LLINs are now used exclusively in net distribution campaigns. A conventional ITN is a net that has been soaked with insecticide within the last 12 months.\n\nThere is a growing recognition that surveys of the coverage of health interventions should describe how equitably interventions are implemented among different economic groups. Answers to questions 121 to 127, when paired with the wealth index, can indicate whether ownership of ITNs is associated with poverty.\n\nThe following limitations should be noted. First, because of issues of recall, this survey may not provide reliable estimates of net retreatment status. Second, it may be difficult to interpret the findings at the  national level, as malaria transmission is most often localized; if the survey is limited to malaria-endemic areas, however, the interpretation will be clearer. Third, the indicator may be biased by the seasonality of survey data collection, which is most often done during the peak transmission season, when reported net ownership and use may be higher than during non-peak transmission periods. In addition, the questionnaire does not ask whether the insecticide used to treat the net is an approved insecticide. There are also no questions about whether the net was washed after treatment or about the physical condition of the net (holes, tears, etc.), which can reduce its effectiveness.", "quality_control":"", "notes":"", "published":1, "weight":1189, "created":"", "changed":""},

A significant proportion of anemia in children under age 5 in malaria-endemic areas is due to malaria. Severe anemia is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in malaria-endemic areas. Malaria-related anemia is associated with worsening of preexisting anemia and with infant deaths.\n\nIn malaria, the development, the rate of progression, and the degree of anemia depend on the severity and duration of the presence of the malaria parasite in the blood. Malaria causes anemia when the malaria parasite enters into the red blood cell and the malaria-infected red blood cell is then broken down (hemolyzed). Malaria infection can also cause red blood cell production to slow down. Anemia results if the breakdown of red blood cells is faster than the production of new cells.\n\nDemonstrated reductions in severe anemia among children under age 5 in malaria intervention trials support the use of anemia in young children as an indicator of malaria burden and the impact of malaria interventions in stable transmission settings. Therefore, Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group (MERG) has recommended that anemia testing of children under age 5 be included in all Malaria Indicator Surveys conducted in areas of stable malaria transmission. The current recommended procedure is to measure hemoglobin levels using the HemoCue\u00ae instrument on blood collected from a finger prick in children ages 6\u201359 months. The recommended procedures for conducting anemia testing are described in the separate Demographic and Health Surveys anemia testing manual (Anemia Testing in Population-Based Surveys, MEASURE DHS, ICF International, Calverton, Maryland, USA).\n\nMalaria parasite prevalence is a useful indicator of malaria burden. Our understanding of the epidemiology of malaria can be improved and the progress of control efforts can be tracked more effectively if estimates of parasite prevalence are available in conjunction with intervention coverage data. Malaria testing may include the use of a malaria rapid diagnostic test\u2014for which results are available to the field team\u2014and microscopy of patient blood smears, the results of which are available after fieldwork is complete. The RBM MERG has recommended that malaria parasitemia testing of children ages 6\u201359 months be included in the Malaria Indicator Surveys in areas of stable malaria transmission, which is ideally conducted during the high-transmission season for malaria.\n\nQuestions 207\u2013210 are designed to obtain permission for a medical referral to assess and possibly treat anemia and malaria infection, if the results of anemia and malaria testing indicate the presence of malaria.

Malaria in pregnant women can cause several complications that are dangerous to the mother and unborn child, including severe malaria and death, maternal anemia, and low birth weight of the newborn. The World Health Organization recommends that pregnant women in malaria endemic areas take a treatment dose of SP/Fansidar (usually three tablets taken all at once), as a preventive measure, once a month during the third trimester of pregnancy (months 7, 8, and 9 of the pregnancy). Preventive treatment with SP/Fansidar at least twice during pregnancy, usually given during antenatal care visits, is known as intermittent preventive treatment in pregnant women (IPTp). The generic name for SP/Fansidar is sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, but there can be other brand names.\n\nThe objective of this section is to obtain information about health care related to childbearing including antenatal care, delivery care, and postnatal care for the woman and her newborn. The section includes questions about births that occurred in January [2008] or later.\n\nAntenatal Care and Preventive Treatment (301\u2013311)\n\nThe questions in this section refer to the pregnancy for the most recent birth (whether now living or not) within the six years preceding the survey. Malaria infections can cause several pregnancy-related complications. The clinical picture of malaria infection during pregnancy may range from asymptomatic to severe, life-threatening illness, depending on the mother\u2019s natural immunity to malaria, the number of pregnancies she has had, the climate, and the level of malaria transmission in the area (endemic or epidemic). Maternal death may result either directly from severe malaria or indirectly from malariarelated complications including severe anemia. In addition, malaria may result in a range of adverse pregnancy outcomes, including low birth weight, spontaneous abortion, and neonatal death. Interventions to reduce the risks of related malaria pregnancy complications include the use of ITNs and preventive antimalarial drugs.\n\nAntimalarial drugs, such as sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP)/Fansidar, can be used to prevent infection or treat a presumed infection in pregnant women. The World Health Organization (WHO) and the RBM partnership recommend that all pregnant women in areas with stable malaria transmission receive at least two preventive treatment doses of an effective antimalarial drug (usually SP/Fansidar) during routine antenatal clinic visits. Administration of two doses of SP/Fansidar during pregnancy has been shown to reduce the prevalence of deliveries of low birth weight babies, as well as malaria-related morbidity in pregnant women.\n\nInformation on whether SP/Fansidar (or any other country-specific drug for IPT) was given during an antenatal visit or another visit to a health facility is collected to determine whether RBM recommendations are being followed.\n\nThe following limitations should be noted. Retrospective questions about IPT given during a previous pregnancy may be subject to recall bias. It is difficult to determine at what stage during pregnancy IPT was given. IPT use may be misleading at the national level, as malaria transmission is most often localized and local malaria transmission may affect adherence to national IPT guidelines. Estimates on the type of antimalarial drug taken may be unreliable because of poor recall.", "quality_control":"", "notes":"", "published":1, "weight":1194, "created":"", "changed":""},

Domestic servants, relatives and other workers living and eating in the household are to be included as household members (even if they spend the weekend elsewhere and stay with the household the rest of the week). Three unrelated persons who live and cook meals together would be considered to form one household.\n\nCollective living arrangements (also referred to as institutional populations) such as hostels, army camps, boarding schools, or prisons are not considered as households.\n\nOne should make a distinction between a family and a household. The first reflects blood descent and marriage. The second is used in this survey to identify an economic/social unit. Interviewers must be conscious and use the criteria provided on household membership to determine which individuals make a particular household.\n\nNote that the List of Household Members includes HL1.

Interviewers must obtain a complete list of all persons who usually live in the household, but do not need to fill in or do anything in this column since the numbers are already provided. This is a very important number: Once household members are assigned these line numbers after the List of Household Members is completed, all members are identified with these line numbers throughout the questionnaires administered in this household.\n\nA household head is a usual resident member of the household acknowledged by the other members of the household as the household head. This person may be acknowledged as the head on the basis of age (older), sex (generally, but not necessarily, male), economic status (main provider), or some other reason. It is up to the respondents to define who heads the household. Interviewers are not required to assess who the household head is most likely to be, or whether the person stated as the household head has the relevant characteristics to be the household head.\n\nIf  a household has more than 15 members, mark the box following line 15.

When the respondent is asked to provide the names of persons living in the household, their relationship to the head of the household and their sex is naturally mentioned during the course of listing the names. For this reason, the list is completed vertically for HL2, HL3 and HL4 during the first stage.

It involves total or partial removal of the external female genitalia for non-medical reasons. The procedure is performed on young girls, usually before they reach the age of puberty. It is frequently performed without anaesthesia, particularly in rural areas, by traditional birth attendants and/or circumcision practitioners.\n\nThe World Health Organization has identified four types of FGM/C:\nType I: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and/or the prepuce. In medical literature this form of FGM/C is also referred to as \u2018clitoridectomy\u2019.\n\nType II: Partial or total removal of the clitoris and labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora. In English, this type of cutting is often referred to as \u2018excision\u2019.\n\nType III: Narrowing of the vaginal orifice by cutting and bringing together the labia minora and/or the labia majora to create a type of seal, with or without excision of the clitoris. In most instances, the cut edges of the labia are stitched together, which is referred to as \u2018infibulation\u2019.\n\nType IV: All other harmful procedures to the female genitalia for non-medical purposes, for example: pricking, piercing, incising, scraping and cauterization. Pricking or nicking involves cutting to draw blood, but no removal of tissue and no permanent alteration of the external genitalia.", "quality_control":"", "notes":"After determining if the respondent has ever heard of FGM/C in questions FG1 and FG2, the module contains questions to determine if the respondent was circumcised (FG3) and, if so, the type of circumcision and the type of practitioner who performed the procedure (FG4 to FG8). Questions related to the type of circumcision (FG4 and FG5) are intended to differentiate whether there has been removal of genital flesh or not (FG4 and FG5), and whether the genial area was sewn closed (FG6).\n\nThe second set of questions FG12-FG21 is related to the respondent\u2019s daughter(s). These allow for the tracking of intergenerational changes in the practice of FGM/C.

To ensure that the relevant respondents are identified, the questionnaire begins by listing all household members \u2013 that is, persons who usually live in the household (* note) \u2013 adults and children. A household is a person or group of persons who usually live and eat together. Adapt this definition to fit the definition of a household in use in your country. It is very important that this household list includes children who reside in the household and do not live with their biological parents. The total number of household members is later used to compute indicators for water and sanitation. Basic demographic information \u2013 age, sex and relationship to the household head \u2013 is obtained in this module. \r\n\r\nInformation on age and sex is very important, since eligibility of household members for administration of the individual questionnaires, as well as for several modules, is based on age and sex. Information on age is in terms of completed ages , as well as date of birth. The process of listing household members can be time-consuming, especially in households with very old individuals who do not know their ages. For this survey, the precise age of adults outside the prime reproductive and working years is not as vital as in other surveys. To conserve interview time, the code \u201898\u2019 is provided for those older than 50 years of age whose precise age is not known. \r\n\r\nEligibility for the Questionnaire for Individual Women and for the Questionnaire for Children Under Five has already been emphasized (Household Listing Form questions 7 and 9, or HL7 and HL9). Children are linked to their mother or primary caretaker through the mother\u2019s or primary caretaker\u2019s line number from the household list. \r\n\r\nInformation on HL8 will be used during the analysis of various indicators. While this information is compulsory for the child labour and child discipline modules, it is also used to match the household respondent and the mother/caretaker and compare the responses of the two, for various indicators that use children 5-14 in their denominators.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, information on HL10 will be used during the analysis of insecticide treated nets modules and this question should be kept if insecticide treated nets module has been included.\r\n\r\nFinally, there are questions to measure two important indicators: children\u2019s living arrangements and prevalence of orphans living in households. For all household members under age 18, the questions ask if the biological mother and father are still alive and, if so, whether they live in the same household (HL11-14). These indicators are especially important in countries where adult mortality from AIDS poses severe threats to family well-being. It may also be possible to examine whether these children are more disadvantaged with respect to other indicators, such as education, than children living with their biological parents.\r\n\r\n(*) In MICS4, only de jure members (individuals who usually live in the household) are recorded in the household listing. Some countries may opt for a de facto sample, including all usual members as well as visitors to the household (determined by using a standard definition of a visitor, such as those who slept in the household the previous night), and selecting for analysis only the de facto household members. Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nGENERAL NOTES\r\n\r\nCheck the definition of \u2018household\u2019 in use in the country. This will normally be the definition used in the census. Use this definition in the survey.\r\n\r\nA household is a person or group of persons who usually live and eat together. \r\n\r\nA household is defined as a person or group of persons\r\no who are related or unrelated, \r\no who live together in the same dwelling unit, \r\no who acknowledge one adult male or female as the head of household, \r\no who share the same living arrangements, and\r\no who are considered as one unit. \r\n\r\nIn some cases one may find a group of people living together in the same dwelling, but each person has separate eating arrangements; they should be counted as separate one-person households. Domestic servants, relatives and other workers living and eating in the household are to be included as household members (even if they spend the weekend elsewhere and stay with the household the rest of the week). Three unrelated persons who live and cook meals together would be considered to form one household.\r\n\r\nCollective living arrangements (also referred to as institutional populations) such as hostels, army camps, boarding schools, or prisons are not considered as households.\r\n\r\nOne should make a distinction between a family and a household. The first reflects blood decent and marriage. The second is used in this survey to identify an economic unit. You must be conscious and use the criteria provided on household membership to determine which individuals make a particular household.\r\n\r\nThe Household Listing Form will be completed in two stages: first, names (HL2), relationship codes (HL3) and sex (HL4) of all household members are recorded until all household members are included in the list. When the respondent is asked to provide the names of persons living in the household, their relationship to the head of the household and their sex is naturally mentioned during the course of listing the names. For this reason, the list is completed vertically for HL2, HL3 and HL4 during the first stage. Then, questions from HL5 to HL14 are asked for each person before moving to the next person.\r\n\r\nAFTER FILLING THE LISTING FORM:\r\n\r\nProbe for additional household members. \r\nProbe especially for any infants or small children not listed, and others who may not be members of the family (such as servants, friends) but who usually live in the household. \r\nInsert names of additional members in the household list and complete form accordingly.\r\n\r\nNow for each woman age 15-49 years, write her name and line number and other identifying information in the information panel of a separate Individual Women\u2019s Questionnaire.\r\nFor each child under age 5, write his/her name and line number AND the line number of his/her mother or caretaker in the information panel of a separate Under-5 Questionnaire.\r\nYou should now have a separate questionnaire for each eligible woman and each child under five in the household.", "quality_control":"", "notes":"", "published":0, "weight":1249, "created":"", "changed":""},

These questions are not needed to estimate MICS4 indicators, but can help to characterize the social status of the household. This information will be useful if the data are analysed further. Responses to these questions can be obtained from those at home at the time of the interview. However, the main respondent to the Household Questionnaire can also provide proxy responses to these questions. \r\n\r\nEXAMPLE:\r\nYou may want to discover if messages about National Immunization Days (NID) are reaching mothers with little or no schooling. Children who participated in the last NID can be tabulated according to the number of years their mothers or caregivers attended school.\r\n\r\nCurrent and recent school attendance of children and young adults aged 5 to 24 years is also obtained through questions in the \u2018Education\u2019 module (ED5-8). Questions about current school attendance cover children and young adults aged 5 through 24 years. All countries should retain this age range.

Accordingly, questions to monitor these indicators have changed slightly. The WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme on Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) has prepared detailed guidelines for measuring progress towards water and sanitation goals.  \r\n\r\nIn the MICS4 questionnaire, the response categories for questions about the source of drinking water and type of toilet facility have been adjusted to reflect new standardized definitions of \u2018improved\u2019 sources of drinking water and \u2018improved\u2019 sanitary means of excreta disposal. The following sources of drinking water are now defined as improved: water that is piped into a dwelling, yard or plot; public tap or standpipe; tube-well or borehole; protected dug well or protected spring; and rainwater collection. Bottled water is not considered an improved water source; it is only considered improved if water used for other purposes (\u2018Water and Sanitation\u2019 module, question WS2) is obtained from an improved water source. WS2 is asked only to respondents who indicated under WS1 to use bottled water as their main drinking water source. Since usually a large proportion of these respondents also have a regular piped drinking water supply into their households, WS2 is designed to capture that information.\r\n\r\nA question about how much time it takes to collect water is also provided in the module. To assess whether gender and generational differences exist among the persons who are usually responsible for hauling water for the household, WS5 is asked.\r\n\r\nAs programmes begin to promote home treatment of water to make it safer to drink, countries will want to monitor their success. To provide a baseline measure of home treatment of drinking water, two questions are asked (WS6-7).\r\n\r\nThe international indicator for measuring achievement of sanitation goals is the \u2018proportion of population with access to improved sanitation\u2019. For this international indicator, the new, standardized definition of an acceptable \u2018sanitary facility\u2019 is a flush facility that flushes to a piped sewer system, septic tank, or pit (latrine); a ventilated improved pit latrine; a pit latrine with a slab, or a composting latrine. A pit latrine with a slab is defined as a dry pit latrine whereby the pit is fully covered by a slab except for the seat or drop hole. The slab can be made of any material. The new categories for WS8 make it easier to identify the type of toilet facility used by members of the household.\r\n\r\nDefinitions of each water source and type of sanitary facility listed are found in MICS Manual Chapter \u2018Instructions for Interviewers\u2019. Pictorial aids are also available on the Internet to use when training fieldworkers.  Note that these pictorials aids should not be shown to respondents and should be used only for training interviewers. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of questions WS9-11 is to learn whether the household shares its sanitation facility with other households. The shared status of a sanitation facility is important because shared facilities can be less hygienic than facilities used by only a single household. Unhygienic conditions (faeces on the floor, seat or wall, and flies) may discourage use of the facility. Shared or public sanitation facilities are also considered to be less accessible than individual household facilities compromising use especially by women and children.\r\n\r\nSurvey coordinators will need to pre-test these questions to determine whether additional water sources, sanitary facilities, or types of home water treatment not already listed but typically used in the country need to be added to this list.

Such information will also be invaluable for later in-depth analysis. Further analyses will allow you to evaluate the equity of health programme coverage in your country, differentials in behavioural patterns by socio-economic status, and to assess disparities by wealth. If the data can identify population subgroups or geographic areas in need of special effort, programmes can be re-designed to help reach these groups and keep them on target.\r\n\r\nThe questions in this module require that response categories be adapted for specific country settings (HC1A\u2013HC1C) and allow for local construction materials (HC3-5). Several questions are included that can be used to construct an index of household wealth and can also be used to monitor a MDG indicator on use of solid fuels. In addition, information about cooking arrangements obtained in HC8 can be combined with information about type of fuel (HC6). This information can be used to monitor child survival programmes that aim to prevent respiratory illnesses. \r\n\r\nFinally, there are two questions to record possessions owned by the household and its members.

The discriminatory power of the wealth index improves when increased numbers of household and personal items are included in the \u2018Household Characteristics\u2019 module.\r\n\r\nRecent research has shown that the inclusion of information on ownership of land and animals can increase the power of the index to distinguish the poor from the very poor in rural areas.

 {"id":1253, "alternate_id":"ID_633977117434758000", "name":"MICS 4 - Insecticide Treated Nets", "description":"Malaria is a major killer in many countries around the world, and its control is specifically mentioned in the Millennium Development Goals. One of the three key strategies for combating malaria identified by the Roll Back Malaria (RBM) Partnership is vector control through insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs). Nets used for sleeping that have been treated with an insecticide to repel or kill mosquitoes can substantially reduce malaria transmission, and programmes to provide access to ITNs are under way in many countries. \r\n\r\nThis module provides questions to measure a number of key RBM indicators, including \u2018proportion of households that possess at least one ITN\u2019 and \u2018children under five sleeping under an ITN\u2019, the latter also being an MDG indicator. The household ITN module has thus expanded since previous rounds of MICS to measure which household members slept under an ITN the night before the survey in addition to measuring household ownership of nets. Thus, the new module not only allows for the measurement of proportion of children under five who slept under an ITN, but also the proportion of pregnant women and the proportion of all household members..\r\n\r\nThe Roll Back Malaria Partnership considers malaria to be endemic in 106 countries. Some of those countries report that no transmission is currently occurring, or very few localized cases, and the use of this module is not appropriate in those countries. However, in areas at risk of malaria and in malaria-endemic countries where malaria transmission is known to be occurring, this module (and the \u2018Malaria\u2019 module for children under five, which focuses on treatment of fever) should be included in the questionnaire. \r\n\r\nA net treated with insecticide is effective in repelling or killing mosquitoes before they have the chance to bite. Various types of nets are available. \u2018Long-lasting Insecticidal Nets\u2019 are ready-to-use, factory-pretreated nets that require no further treatment for 4 to 5 years. Efforts are now being made to scale up their production. Other types of nets require treatment with an insecticide every 6 to12 months. These nets can be purchased already pre-treated with an insecticide or untreated, and can be treated or re-treated later.\r\n\r\nIf you plan to include the malaria modules in MICS, you should contact the national malaria control programme in your country to obtain information on the different brands of nets used in the country. \r\n\r\nSurvey coordinators must work closely with knowledgeable professionals in the national malaria control programme to identify all brands of treated mosquito nets that are available in the country, as well as prevention and treatment policies (covered in the other two malaria modules, for women and children under five). The pre-test will provide an opportunity to ensure that all common brands are included in the questionnaire and will also indicate whether respondents are generally willing to allow interviewers into their sleeping areas to observe the nets.\r\n\r\nThis module contains questions to identify whether a household possesses insecticide-treated mosquito net(s) and, if so, who slept under the net or nets the night before the interview. Each net is asked about separately. The first step is to identify the type of net with questions about the brands of treated and untreated nets available in the household, the length of time that the household has owned a pre-treated net, and, if applicable, when the most recent treatment of a net occurred. Then, the respondent is asked who slept under the net the previous night.\r\n\r\nSometimes respondents do not know the brand name of the net or nets the household owns, and interviewers may attempt to examine the net to identify the brand. It is often difficult to actually observe nets used for sleeping, because families are concerned about the privacy of their sleeping quarters. In this case, the interviewer may try to identify the brand of net using pictorial aids. Survey coordinators will need to arrange to have photographs of each brand\u2019s logo, if there is one, or the packaging in which the treated nets are sold to help with identification. Each interviewer should be given a copy of these photographs to show to respondents to assist them in identifying different brands of nets in the field.

It teaches children self-control and acceptable behaviour. Although the need for child discipline is broadly recognized, there is considerable debate regarding violent physical and psychological disciplinary practices. Research has found that violent practices have negative impacts on children\u2019s mental and social development. Harsh discipline is also a violation of a child\u2019s right to protection from all forms of violence while in the care of their parents or other caregivers, as set forth in the Convention on the Rights of the Child.\r\n\r\nFew data are available on how parents and other caregivers discipline children, especially in low- and middle-income countries. This makes it difficult to describe the nature of child disciplinary practices, their extent and their consequences \u2013 and to develop evidence-based strategies that can improve those practices. Additional data on the nature and prevalence of child disciplinary \r\n\r\npractices worldwide are needed to establish baselines, inform the development of more effective parenting strategies and monitor progress.

Research conducted by the USAID-supported Environmental Health Project, and its successor the Hygiene Improvement Project as well as studies from other leading researchers in the field of hand washing, have found that observation of a designated place used for hand washing in the household and the presence of soap and water at that specific place is a robust objective indicator for handwashing behavior.  A designated place for hand washing is the place that an interviewer is shown by a respondent as the place where members of the household most often wash their hands.\r\n\r\nThe presence of soap and water at a specific place for handwashing indicates that, at a minimum, the tools necessary for washing hands are present in the same place.  Moreover, there is some evidence to suggest that having soap / water at a designated place for handwashing is associated with reduced disease risk.\r\n\r\nResearch has found that the likelihood that people wash their hands at critical times is highest in households which have a designated place for hand washing where water and soap are present at the designated place.\r\n\r\nFor correct hand washing to take place at the designated place the presence of water \u2013 standing or running water \u2013 and the presence of any type or soap (bar, liquid, or powder) is a prerequisite. \r\n\r\nThe presence of any kind of soap (bar, liquid or powder) anywhere in the household is an indication that the household has access to a market that sells soap, and apparently is aware of some of the benefits of using soap. This information is likely more relevant for rural than for urban areas.\r\n\r\nThe questions in this module do not ask respondents about specific times when they wash or should wash their hands. Research conducted by the Demographic and Health Survey found that self-reporting in hand washing behaviour leads to significant over reporting. Further research determined that the presence of a designated place for hand washing with water and soap present is the best indicator for the likelihood that hand washing actually takes place. For the moment this is deemed the best possible information on hand washing that can be obtained through a MICS type of household survey.

Monitoring progress towards this goal is an important but difficult objective. Measuring childhood mortality may seem easy, but attempts using direct questions, such as \u201cHas anyone in this household died in the last year?\u201d give inaccurate results. And using direct measures of child mortality from birth histories is time consuming and complicated.  Demographers have therefore had to devise ways to measure childhood mortality indirectly. These \u2018indirect methods\u2019 minimize the pitfalls of memory lapses, inexact or misinterpreted definitions, and poor interviewing technique. \r\n\r\nOne of the most reliable methods is known as the \u2018children ever born/children surviving\u2019 (CEB/CS), or Brass, method of mortality estimation. This method uses data from a few simple questions about the number of live births a woman has ever had and the number of those children who have died to derive estimates of infant and under-five mortality. It does not require respondents to provide dates of birth or death, so the data can be gathered quickly. \r\n\r\nThe original version of the CEB/CS method \u2013 referred to in this manual as the \u2018age-based\u2019 method \u2013 relies on women\u2019s reports of their ages to estimate the length of time that children have been exposed to the risk of dying. This is the main method that should be used in the current MICS; the \u2018Child Mortality\u2019 module in the model questionnaire includes the necessary questions for it. \r\n\r\nHowever, in countries where pregnancy outside marriage is rare, there is sometimes sensitivity about asking unmarried women about any births they may have had. Where questions on children\u2019s births and deaths can only be asked of women who have ever been married, estimates of child mortality using the \u2018age-based\u2019 method becomes more complicated. In these countries, which are relatively few in number, the \u2018marriage duration\u2019 variant of the method should be used, based on questions from the \u2018Marriage/Union\u2019 module. Before designing the questionnaire, survey coordinators and their technical advisers need to decide which version of the CEB/CS method to use.\r\n\r\nData collection, calculation and interpretation of mortality estimates are complex undertakings. You should enlist the help of a local demographer or statistician who is conversant with these methods before you conduct the survey.  You should also obtain the recommended publications to assist you and your consultant demographer to collect, analyse and interpret these findings.   \r\n\r\nIt is important to note that if a woman has had no live births, the rest of the \u2018Child Mortality\u2019 module and the next two modules are skipped over and the interviewer goes on to the \u2018Marriage/Union\u2019 module. If she has ever had a live birth, the interviewer goes on to administer the entire \u2018Child Mortality\u2019 module. The information from this module is combined with information on her age to make the estimates. The final segment of this module (CM11-12) inquires about live births within the past 2 years and has to be retained (along with CM1), even if the \u2018Child Mortality\u2019 module is omitted, to determine eligibility for the \u2018Maternal and Newborn Health\u2019 module. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nGENERAL NOTES\r\n\r\nThis module is to be administered to all eligible women age 15-49.

For month of birth in BH4, it is permissible to record Code \u201898\u2019 for Don\u2019t Know as an answer.  However, for year of birth (BH4), age of living children (BH6), and age at death (BH9), you must record an answer, even if it is only your best estimate.  It is very important to obtain information for these questions, so you must probe for this information and make your best estimate on the basis of the woman\u2019s answers.\r\n\r\n2) Recording of information on twins. If there are any twins, record the information about each twin on a separate line.  If the twins are the respondent\u2019s last birth and if one twin is dead, record the living twin last. By doing this, you will be able to talk about the living twin first when you get to MN Section, which may be more comforting for the respondent.\r\n\r\n3) Recording information for more than 14 births.  There are lines for 14 births in the table.  If you find a respondent with more than 14 births, write at the bottom of the table continued on a separate Form.

Note that a number of questions, particularly those that relate to who provided ANC and delivery care and where the delivery took place require modification during the questionnaire adaptation and pre-test to ensure that the categories are appropriate for the country. However, it is important to note that provider questions are used to calculated to key MDG5 indicators \u2013 at least one antenatal visit with a skilled health personnel and skilled attendant at delivery \u2013 and thus any adaptation should remain consistent with international definitions of skilled health personnel. \r\n\r\nTo estimate tetanus toxoid (TT) coverage among children under 1 year of age, mothers who have given birth in the 2 years preceding the survey are asked about their tetanus toxoid immunizations (Mothers often do not possess a card on which their own immunizations are recorded, but their recall is usually adequate). Although a woman may not have received immunizations during the last pregnancy, an infant can be protected against TT if the mother received immunizations during previous pregnancies and the module has been designed to measure coverage even if the immunizations were received in the past. \r\n\r\nIn malaria-affected countries, several questions are available in the Maternal and Newborn Health module to estimate the effectiveness of programmes to provide pregnant women with intermittent preventive treatment for malaria. \r\n\r\nMalaria infections can cause several pregnancy-related complications, malaria-related severe anaemia, and can even result in maternal death. In addition, malaria may cause adverse outcomes for the foetus, including low birthweight, spontaneous abortion and neonatal death. Interventions to reduce the risks of malaria-related pregnancy complications include the use of antimalarial drugs during pregnancy. The current recommendation from the Roll Back Malaria Partnership is to provide all pregnant women in areas with stable malaria transmission with at least two preventive treatment doses of an effective antimalarial drug (usually SP/Fansidar, a combination of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine) during routine antenatal clinic visits. Three questions to estimate the use of intermittent preventive treatment are included in this module for areas where there is a malaria risk and countries where malaria is endemic.\r\n\r\nThe appropriateness of including these questions in the MICS will depend upon your country\u2019s policy regarding intermittent preventive treatment. Survey coordinators must work closely with knowledgeable professionals in the national malaria control programme to decide if these questions should be included.\r\n\r\nMeasurement of Caesarean-section (C-section) is new to MICS4. It is estimated that delivery via C-section may be necessary in approximately 5-15 percent of births. Levels of C-section that fall either below 5 percent or above 15 percent, whether at the national level or for sub-national populations, can provide programme managers with useful information.\r\n\r\nThere are also questions in this module that are used to estimate the incidence of low birthweight. Mothers are asked to give the numerical birthweight of their children, as well as to assess the relative size of their babies at birth. The relationship between mothers\u2019 assessment of relative size and the numerical weight for babies who were weighed at birth is then used to estimate the weight of infants for whom only relative size is available. They produce data to make a good estimate, in the aggregate, of the prevalence of low birthweight even for countries where many newborns are not weighed at birth. ,   These questions also enable one to calculate the proportion of babies not weighed at birth.\r\n\r\nQuestions are also asked to measure the prevalence of timely breastfeeding initiation, an important indicator of newborn care. Early initiation of breastfeeding \u2013 putting the infant to mother\u2019s breast within one hour of birth \u2013 provides the infant with colostrum, which is not only highly nutritious, but which protects babies from infection before their immune systems have developed. This practice contributes to reducing overall neonatal mortality and reducing a mother\u2019s risk of post-partum hemorrhage, one of the leading causes of maternal mortality. \r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nGENERAL NOTES\r\n\r\nThis module is to be administered to all women with a live birth in the 2 years preceding date of interview.

MICS defines a \u201cpostnatal care visit\u201d as a contact with a provider occurring after discharge, in the case of facility deliveries, or after the birth attendant leaves the home, in the case of home deliveries. MICS defines a \u201cpostnatal health check (in two days of birth)\u201d as any check on health whether occurring immediately or soon after delivery (while in facility or at home) or within two days of delivery, regardless of location of the check, so as to be able to measure the global indicator using a definition similar to DHS. This is a different indicator than postnatal visit.\r\n\r\nThe MICS Post-natal Health Checks module is structured to collect information on births regardless of place of delivery. Furthermore, the objective is to collect information on newborns\u2019 and mothers\u2019 contact with a provider, not content of care. The rationale for this is that as post natal care (PNC) programmes scale up, it is important to measure the coverage of that scale up and ensure that the platform for providing essential services is in place. Content is considered more difficult to measure, particularly because the respondent is asked to recall services delivered up to two years preceding the interview. \r\n\r\nThis module is asked to women with a live birth in the two years preceding the date of interview. In order to obtain information on postnatal health contacts, each respondent is asked a series of questions about the care that she and her newborn received. The module appears rather lengthy and complex because it is necessary to ask different questions of women who deliver in a facility versus those who do not. However, only sub-sets of questions are applicable for each individual respondent.\r\n\r\nEach respondent with a birth within the last two years (CM13=One or more live births in last two years) will be asked a subset of the questions in the module. Questions about a post-natal health check are asked separately for the baby and for the mother.\r\n\r\n\u2022 For births that occurred in a health facility, questions are asked to establish whether anyone checked on the health of the baby and on the health of the mother before they left the facility. We also ask about any post-discharge checks on health. If a health check did occur after leaving the facility, we ask when the check occurred, who performed the check, and where it took place. \r\n\r\n\u2022 For births that occurred outside a health facility, the respondent is asked if the birth attendant provided any health check before leaving the mother and baby. Then she is asked if there was any health check after the attendant left and, if so, when the check occurred, who performed the check, and where it took place. \r\n\r\n\u2022 For births that occurred outside a facility with no attendant present, the respondent is asked whether there was any check on her baby\u2019s health at some point after delivery and, if so, when the check occurred, who performed the check, and where it took place. The same sequence of questions is asked about checks on the mother\u2019s health. \r\n\r\nAll respondents, regardless of place of delivery and whether or not the delivery was attended, are asked a series of questions about postnatal care visits. Questions are asked about a first PNC visit for the newborn and then asked about a first PNC visit for the mother herself.

It is extremely important that your interviewers ensure absolute privacy when administering this module. It is also important that the women consent to answering these questions. It must be clear to every woman interviewed that she is free to refuse to respond to these questions if she is uncomfortable answering them.

In some countries, you may decide to obtain parental consent before administering the questionnaire to women under age 18.

This is followed by questions concerning the relationship she had to the man with whom she last had sex and condom use at that time. The prevalence of sex with non-marital partners among young women and sex with multiple partners are also measured as well as the proportion of these women who used a condom when having sex the last time they had sex with a non-marital partner, which is a Millennium Development Goal indicator.\r\n\r\nSex between young women and older men can be especially risky since young women often lack the skills to effectively negotiate safer sex. Moreover, older men are more likely than younger men to be infected with HIV, because they have presumably been sexually active for a longer period of time. The module contains questions about the age of a woman\u2019s last sexual partner, even if she does not know his exact age, in order to estimate the extent of \u2018age-mixing\u2019 in sexual relationships.

The purpose of this module is to obtain information that will help programme managers and policy makers plan more effective programmes to prevent the spread of HIV.\r\n\r\nThe module is meant to be used in all countries, but there are notes on the questionnaire showing where and how several questions may need to be adapted locally. The questions and the indicators that can be constructed from the data they provide were developed by UNAIDS and partners. They are part of a set of indicators used to help monitor changes in knowledge, attitudes and practices that are being promoted in HIV prevention programmes around the world. \r\n\r\nFirst, questions are asked to determine the respondent\u2019s basic knowledge about HIV transmission. Questions are asked about ways to avoid HIV infection and to assess the prevalence of misconceptions about how HIV is transmitted.\r\n\r\nThree questions aim to determine whether a woman knows that the AIDS virus can be transmitted from mother to child. Negative attitudes and discrimination against persons living with HIV affect efforts to prevent transmission and to care for infected individuals. People may be discouraged from seeking HIV testing and treatment services. Several questions are asked to obtain information about discriminatory attitudes and practices.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the remaining questions is to obtain information about the level of unmet need for HIV testing. They first ask about experience of HIV testing among women with a live birth during the last two years. Provider initiated testing and counselling as well as voluntary testing and counselling are encouraged, in the belief that if a person knows his or her HIV status, he or she is more likely to adopt behaviours to prevent contracting the virus or, if positive, of transmitting it and seeking HIV treatment. Many of those who do get tested do not return to receive the test results, but the proportion of those who do return should increase as the quality of pre-test and post-test counselling improves and as people appreciate the importance of HIV testing. To monitor the level of demand for such services, questions are included to obtain an estimate of the number of those tested who return to receive the test result and counselling. For women with a live birth during the last two years who were not tested for HIV and for women without a live birth during the last two years, questions to determine whether the woman was ever tested for HIV and, if tested the timing and if they received the test results are also included. Finally, for those who have not previously been tested, respondents are asked if they know of a place where an HIV test can be performed. \r\n\r\nAs with all the modules in this questionnaire, it is important that interviewers administer this module with care. It is especially important that they be trained to read out each question in this module exactly as it is written, and to ask questions in the order in which they appear. It is essential that the interview be conducted in a confidential setting.\r\n\r\nThroughout this module the term \u201cAIDS virus\u201d is used although, technically speaking, AIDS is the disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  However, among public, the term AIDS is known more widely compared to HIV and the distinction between AIDS and HIV may not be very clear.  In order to avoid \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d responses to the question, this module uses the term AIDS virus. During the training, this should be emphasized and interviewers should know that the objective is to refer to the virus, not the illness. \r\n\r\nMost of the indicators derived from this module are dependent on each other; care should be taken not to delete questions that contribute to the calculation of related indicators.

Monitoring progress towards this vital target is an important but difficult task. A majority of countries still lack a complete civil registration system with good attribution of cause of death, making it challenging to accurately assess the extent of progress towards MDG 5.\r\n\r\nHousehold surveys are one of the sources that supply maternal mortality estimates in the absence of complete and accurate civil registration systems although, like other sources, it has its own set of limitations in estimating the true levels of maternal mortality.\r\n\r\nMICS4, as well as DHS, uses the \u2018direct sisterhood method\u2019 to measure maternal mortality at the country level. This method obtains information by interviewing a representative sample of respondents about the survival of all their siblings (to determine the age of all siblings, how many are alive, how many are dead, age at death and year of death of those dead, and among sisters who reached reproductive age, how many died during pregnancy, delivery, or within two months of pregnancy). Although this approach is an important source of information for maternal mortality estimation, it has the following limitations: it identifies pregnancy-related deaths, rather than maternal deaths; it produces estimates with wide confidence intervals, thereby diminishing opportunities for trend analysis; it provides a retrospective rather than a current maternal mortality estimate (usually referring to a period of 0-6 or 0-9 years prior to the survey); the analysis is more complicated than other key maternal health indicators. The sisterhood method is not appropriate for use in countries likely to have a low maternal mortality ratio or where fertility is very low. \r\n\r\nMeasuring maternal mortality poses considerable difficulty. Because maternal deaths are rare events, even in countries with very high risk, large samples are usually required. Even with very large surveys it is difficult to estimate time trends in maternal mortality. Furthermore, maternal mortality is usually underreported. The estimates generated by the measurement techniques currently available are too imprecise to permit meaningful monitoring of maternal mortality over time. Furthermore, estimates can only be generated at the national level, and so no subnational disaggregation is possible. Countries should not attempt to measure the maternal mortality ratio more often than every 10 years or so. In the short term, indicators of health service use and quality of care are preferred for monitoring progress towards the MDGs. For example, the care a woman receives at the time of delivery is linked to improved health outcomes. Attendance at delivery by skilled health personnel as well as antenatal care can be used as proxy indicators of the impact of programmes to reduce maternal mortality.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nGENERAL NOTES\r\n\r\nQuestions MM8 to MM13 will only be asked about brothers and sisters who have died.", "quality_control":"", "notes":"", "published":0, "weight":1275, "created":"", "changed":""},

The purpose of this module is to obtain information that will help programme managers and policy makers plan more effective programmes to prevent the spread of HIV.\r\n\r\nThe module is meant to be used in all countries, but there are notes on the questionnaire showing where and how several questions may need to be adapted locally. The questions and the indicators that can be constructed from the data they provide were developed by UNAIDS and partners. They are part of a set of indicators used to help monitor changes in knowledge, attitudes and practices that are being promoted in HIV prevention programmes around the world. \r\n\r\nFirst, questions are asked to determine the respondent\u2019s basic knowledge about HIV transmission. Questions are asked about ways to avoid HIV infection and to assess the prevalence of misconceptions about how HIV is transmitted.\r\n\r\nThree questions aim to determine whether a man knows that the AIDS virus can be transmitted from mother to child. Negative attitudes and discrimination against persons living with HIV affect efforts to prevent transmission and to care for infected individuals. People may be discouraged from seeking HIV testing and treatment services. Several questions are asked to obtain information about discriminatory attitudes and practices.\r\n\r\nAs with all the modules in this questionnaire, it is important that interviewers administer this module with care. It is especially important that they be trained to read out each question in this module exactly as it is written, and to ask questions in the order in which they appear. It is essential that the interview be conducted in a confidential setting.\r\n\r\nThroughout this module the term \u201cAIDS virus\u201d is used although, technically speaking, AIDS is the disease caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  However, among public, the term AIDS is known more widely compared to HIV and the distinction between AIDS and HIV may not be very clear.  In order to avoid \u201cDon\u2019t know\u201d responses to the question, this module uses the term AIDS virus. During the training, this should be emphasized and interviewers should know that the objective is to refer to the virus, not the illness. \r\n\r\nMost of the indicators derived from this module are dependent on each other; care should be taken not to delete questions that contribute to the calculation of related indicators.

Drawing from the right to a name and nationality contained in article 7 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the 2002 General Assembly Resolution \u2018A World Fit for Children\u2019 reaffirms governments\u2019 commitment to ensure the birth registration of all children and to invest in, care for, educate and protect children from harm and exploitation. In order to achieve these goals, it is necessary for governments to have accurate population data in order to plan service provision for children and their caregivers. Birth registration, therefore, is not only a fundamental right in itself but also key to ensuring the fulfilment of additional rights. A boy or a girl whose birth is not fully registered and who is not provided with a birth certificate is denied the right to a name and nationality, a situation that may also lead to barriers in accessing other rights including health care, education, or social assistance. Later in life, identity documents help protect children against early marriage, child labour, premature enlistment in the armed forces or, if accused of a crime, prosecution as an adult. \r\n \r\nThe birth registration module aims at identifying the extent of the problem of non-registration.

 {"id":1292, "alternate_id":"ID_633977123261358000", "name":"MICS 4 - Early Childhood Development", "description":"Early childhood is a very active period of brain development that lays the foundation for later learning.  A child\u2019s early life has consequences for their adult years.  Poor outcomes in early childhood can be long-lasting, affecting school attainment, employment, wages, criminality, and social skills in adulthood. It is accepted consensus that strong early childhood foundations (including good health, nutrition and a nurturing environment) can help to ensure a smooth transition into primary school, a better chance of completing basic education, and a route out of poverty and disadvantage. \r\n\r\nThis module starts with a question on the existence of children\u2019s book in the household. Exposure to books in the early years not only provides the child with greater understanding of the nature of print, but may also give the child opportunities to see others reading, such as older siblings doing school work.  It is a simple measure to include and is important for later school performance.\r\n\r\nThe module includes questions on the variety and complexity of the child\u2019s play materials. Young children learn by manipulating objects \u2013 testing relationships, sequences and developing a sense of roles and functions in society. They imitate the activities of adults with things, learn social interactions, and keep working on problems (like how to make a simple car) until they can master them. Learning materials need not be purchased. Children enjoy not only store-bought items, but also objects from the household and outside the home. In fact, having learning materials made by family members is more likely to be predictive of later school performance, since it may tell us that the household has a greater recognition of the child\u2019s right to play, and makes a special effort to see that this right is exercised. These home-made toys require no money, but may involve skill and time \u2013 such as a ball made out of banana leaves or a doll from sticks tied together. Poverty probably reduces the number and availability of toys, time to play with them, and the child\u2019s energy to engage with the materials. Conversely, these activities can reduce the effects of poverty on children. \r\n\r\nThe module is also designed to collect information on two measures of potentially unsafe care-giving environments: children left alone, and children left in the care of young caregivers when their mothers are out. There is evidence that these potentially risky care situations may have less positive outcomes than when children are left with more mature caregivers, and are probably associated with an increase in accidents. \r\n\r\nTwo questions are provided to obtain information about attendance at organized early childhood education programmes. These questions only concern children aged 3 and 4 years. These questions are meant to obtain information about programmes that provide learning activities for pre-school children. Child-minding or babysitting alone does not qualify as an \u2018organized, early learning programme\u2019. Survey coordinators should work together with UNICEF and government education advisers to translate this question, and train interviewers to effectively obtain the desired information.\r\n\r\nA young child\u2019s readiness for formal schooling depends very much on a family environment that encourages the child\u2019s learning and development. It is now well recognized that a period of rapid brain development occurs in the first 3 to 4 years of life \u2013 and the quality of the home environment is the major factor determining the child\u2019s development during this period. Many studies in different parts of the world have shown that children from homes where they are exposed to a variety of learning experiences and learning materials are more likely to be successful in their early schooling than children who lack these experiences. \r\n\r\nEarly Childhood Development is the holistic development of children from conception.  Development is defined as the process of change in which the child comes to master more and more complex levels of moving, thinking, feeling and interacting with people and objects in their environment.  There are various aspects of development, and these are called developmental domains such as physical, social, emotional, language and cognitive development.\r\n\r\nChildren will develop at different rates on each of the developmental domains. For example, if you observe 1,000 babies and observe how old they are when they begin moving around, you will generally see children starting to crawl from 6 to 10 months of age.  This age range is considered the normal developmental range for this ability. That is the entire period during which the ability can appear and the child is still considered on course for healthy development.  The rates and patterns of development during the early years are highly variable, and not all children who are doing well are doing the same thing at the same time.\r\n\r\nDevelopmental delay occurs when children have not reached these developmental milestones within the expected time period.  For example, if the normal range for learning to walk is between 9 and 15 months, and a 20-month-old child has still not begun walking, this would be considered a developmental delay.\r\n\r\nThe remaining questions in this module are designed for children age 3 and 4 and a result of rigorous investigation. In 2007, UNICEF commissioned development of a broad set of indicators as potential contributors to a global indicator of child development. Following this, the potential indicators were tested along with other instrumentation in Jordan and the Philippines in the spring and summer 2008. Based on extensive statistical validity, reliability and consistency analyses, an 18-item version was piloted in the MICS4 pilot study in Kenya in February 2009.  As a result of feedback from the field and the outcomes, further analytical procedures led to a shorter version consisting of 10 items, each with yes/no responses, encompassing four major developmental areas: language-cognitive, physical, socio-emotional, and approaches to learning. The resultant Early Child Development Indicator (ECDI) is to contribute to a new/enhanced \u2018Early Childhood Development\u2019 module and will enable countries to 1) Monitor child development over time, 2) compare child development across regions, 3) compare child developmental outcomes to other countries and 4) evaluate ECD interventions and programs.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nGENERAL NOTES\r\n\r\nSocial desirability response bias is a common problem in research and refers to the tendency for people to present a favourable image of themselves. These biased answers confound research results by creating false relationships or obscuring relationships between variables. Sensitive questions may lead respondents to adjust their answers so as to appear politically correct or socially acceptable. Questionnaire items with strong social norms (such as adherence to religious or cultural expectations), or adopting attitudes/activities/objects that are widely considered desirable or undesirable tend to elicit \u201csocially acceptable answers\u201d rather than correct and honest answers.\r\n\r\nTo minimise social response bias it is very important for the interviewers to adopt a non-judgemental attitude and to not display any of their own attitudes, such as cultural or religious values.", "quality_control":"", "notes":"", "published":0, "weight":1292, "created":"", "changed":""},

One of the main aims was to maintain continuity with the established indicators used during the 1990s to track progress related to the World Summit for Children, as well as to harmonize the indicators with those already agreed upon by the international community, including those used in the MDGs. \r\n\r\nThis module covers questions related to treatment of diarrhoea and pneumonia, two of the biggest killers of children under five. Specifically, the questions are limited to illness episodes that occurred in the 2 weeks prior to the survey.\r\n\r\nThe questions about diarrhoea treatment ask about drinking and eating patterns. In addition to asking about oral rehydration salts, the respondent should be asked about homemade fluids that are recommended by the Ministry of Health (MOH). In order to properly adapt the questionnaire, it will be important to involve appropriate MOH personnel who can advise on the types of fluids recommended by the government. Note that homemade fluids NOT recommended by the government can be recorded in a later question (CA7).\r\n\r\nImproper disposal of the faeces of young children poses a risk of diarrhoeal disease. At the end of the module a specific question is asked to provide information about disposing of the waste of young children in the household (CA15).\r\n\r\nA series of questions in the module aim to identify a case of suspected pneumonia or other acute respiratory infection needing assessment by an appropriate health provider (as defined by WHO/UNICEF). \r\n\r\nFor survey identification, the World Health Organization defines these suspected cases of pneumonia as children reported to have had an illness with a cough accompanied by fast and/or difficult breathing.

The definition of \u2018appropriate health care provider\u2019 is usually agreed upon at the country level.

However, the module must still be adapted to reflect vaccines and doses as specified on government-approved vaccination cards. Several vaccines that have come into more common use in countries have been added to the list of potential vaccines.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE:\r\nIn countries where the combined measles, mumps and rubella vaccine (MMR) is used instead of measles vaccine alone, MMR should replace \u2018measles\u2019 in the list, just as it appears on the vaccination card. If both vaccines are in use, retain both items.\r\n\r\nOther antigens may also be used in national immunization programmes, and several possible ones are also listed in the model questionnaire. Remove any antigen that does not appear on vaccination cards and are not in use in your country.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE:\r\nMeasles vaccine is normally given as an injection in the arm at the age of 9 months. In some countries, measles vaccine is now given at 12 months or 15 or 18 months. In some countries, children may receive the vaccine as an injection in the thigh. Question IM16 will need to be adapted to reflect the usual age recommended for measles vaccine.\r\n\r\nVitamin A doses are now sometimes included on a child\u2019s vaccination card, especially if the supplements are delivered in routine child health clinic visits. We have included space for recording the dates of the most recent dose of vitamin A, if recorded on your country\u2019s vaccination cards. If routine doses of vitamin A are indicated on vaccination cards in your country, you will be able to make some assessment of the regularity of dosing. Correct dosing is an important component of supplementation programmes, because children who are deficient in vitamin A need to receive supplements every 4 to 6 months \u2013 at least twice a year.\r\n\r\nA question is also included that asks if any doses not shown on the card were given to the child, including vaccines received during a National Immunization Day. This includes campaigns that provide vaccines other than polio, such as measles immunization campaigns. \r\n\r\nIn some countries, vaccination cards are kept at health centres and are not given to mothers.

The \u2018Immunization\u2019 module should be used in its entirety during the interview, however.\r\n\r\nWhen no vaccination card is available, the caretaker is asked a series of probing questions (IM6-17) to ascertain the type of vaccine and the number of doses, or additional doses received. Lastly, participation in National Immunization Days can be obtained by inserting the dates of the most recent national campaigns (including non-polio campaigns and \u2018vitamin A days\u2019) in IM19 of the module. If possible, include the season of each campaign to help jog the memory of caretakers who cannot recall specific dates. Vaccine coverage rates are calculated based on card records and/or mothers\u2019 responses to probing questions; responses to the question on participation in National Immunization Days will not be added to the calculation of coverage.\r\n\r\nYou should collect information on a number of issues regarding immunization in your country.

To ensure that the relevant respondents are identified, the questionnaire begins by listing all household members - that is, persons who usually live in the household4 - adults and children. \r\n\r\nA household is a person or group of persons who usually live and eat together. Adapt this definition to fit the definition of a household in use in your country. It is very important that this household list includes children who reside in the household and do not live with their biological parents. The total number of household members is later used to compute indicators for water and sanitation. \r\n\r\nBasic demographic information - age, sex and relationship to the household head - is obtained in this module. Information on age and sex is very important, since eligibility of household members for administration of the individual questionnaires, as well as for several modules, is based on age and sex. Information on age is in terms of completed ages.5 The process of listing household members can be time-consuming, especially in households with very old individuals who do not know their ages. For this survey, the precise age of adults outside the prime reproductive and working years is not as vital as in other surveys. To conserve interview time, the code \u201898\u2019 is provided for those older than 50 years of age whose precise age is not known.\r\n\r\nEligibility for the Questionnaire for Individual Women, for the Child Labour module, and for the Questionnaire for Children Under Five has already been emphasized (Household Listing questions 6-8, or HL6-8). Children are linked to their mother or primary caretaker through the mother\u2019s or primary caretaker\u2019s line number from the household list. \r\n\r\nFinally, there are questions to measure two important indicators: children\u2019s living arrangements and prevalence of orphans living in households. For all household members under age 18, the questions ask if the biological mother and father are still alive and, if so, whether they live in the same household (HL9-12).

Accordingly, questions to monitor these indicators have changed slightly. \r\n\r\nThe WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme on Water Supply and Sanitation (JMP) has prepared detailed guidelines for measuring progress towards water and sanitation goals. In the MICS3 questionnaire, the response categories for questions about the source of drinking water and type of toilet facility have been adjusted to reflect new standardized definitions of \u2018improved\u2019 sources of drinking water and \u2018improved\u2019 sanitary means of excreta disposal. \r\n\r\nThe following sources of drinking water are now defined as improved: water that is piped into a dwelling, yard or plot; public tap or standpipe; tube-well or borehole; protected dug well or protected spring; and rainwater collection. Bottled water is not considered an improved water source; it is only considered improved if water used for other purposes (Water and Sanitation module, question WS2) is also from an improved water source. \r\n\r\nA question about how much time it takes to collect water is also provided in the module. To assess whether gender and generational differences exist among the persons who are usually responsible for hauling water for the household, WS4 is asked. As programmes begin to promote home treatment of water to make it safer to drink, countries will want to monitor their success. To provide a baseline measure of home treatment of drinking water, two questions are asked (WS5-6). \r\n\r\nThe international indicator for measuring achievement of sanitation goals is the \u2018proportion of population with access to improved sanitation\u2019. For this international indicator, the new, standardized definition of an acceptable \u2018sanitary facility\u2019 is a flush facility that flushes to a piped sewer system, septic tank, or pit (latrine); a ventilated improved pit latrine; or a pit latrine with a slab. Only a latrine that has a squatting slab, platform or seat that is firmly supported on all sides and is easy to clean and raised above ground level (to prevent surface water from entering the pit) is considered acceptable. The new categories for WS7 make it easier to identify the type of toilet facility used by members of the household. \r\n\r\nDefinitions of each water source and type of sanitary facility listed are found in Appendix Three: Instructions for Interviewers. Pictorial aids are also available on the Internet to use when training fieldworkers.8 Note that these pictorials aids should not be shown to respondents and should be used only for training interviewers. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of questions WS8 and 9 is to learn whether the household shares its sanitation facility with other households. The shared status of a sanitation facility is important because shared facilities can be less hygienic than facilities used by only a single household. Unhygienic conditions (faeces on the floor, seat or wall, and flies) may discourage use of the facility. \r\n\r\nSurvey coordinators will need to pre-test these questions to determine whether additional water sources, sanitary facilities, or types of home water treatment not already listed but typically used in the country need to be added to this list.

Monitoring progress towards this goal is an important but difficult objective. Measuring childhood mortality may seem easy, but attempts using direct questions, such as \u201cHas anyone in this household died in the last year?\u201d give inaccurate results. And using direct measures of child mortality from birth histories is time consuming and complicated. Demographers have therefore had to devise ways to measure childhood mortality indirectly. These \u2018indirect methods\u2019 minimize the pitfalls of memory lapses, inexact or misinterpreted definitions, and poor interviewing technique. \r\n\r\nOne of the most reliable methods is known as the \u2018children ever born/children surviving\u2019 (CEB/CS), or Brass, method of mortality estimation. This method uses data from a few simple questions about the number of live births a woman has ever had and the number of those children who have died to derive estimates of infant and under-five mortality. It does not require respondents to provide dates of birth or death, so the data can be gathered quickly. The original version of the CEB/CS method \u2013 referred to in this manual as the \u2018age-based\u2019 method \u2013 relies on women\u2019s reports of their ages to estimate the length of time that children have been exposed to the risk of dying. This is the main method that should be used in the current MICS; the Child Mortality module in the model questionnaire includes the necessary questions for it. \r\nHowever, in countries where pregnancy outside marriage is rare, there is sometimes sensitivity about asking unmarried women about any births they may have had. Where questions on children\u2019s births and deaths can only be asked of women who have ever been married, estimates of child mortality using the \u2018age-based\u2019 method becomes more complicated. In these countries, which are relatively few in number, the \u2018marriage duration\u2019 variant of the method should be used, based on questions from the Marriage/Union module. Before designing the questionnaire, survey coordinators and their technical advisers need to decide which version of the CEB/CS method to use. \r\n\r\nData collection, calculation and interpretation of mortality estimates are complex undertakings. You should enlist the help of a local demographer or statistician who is conversant with these methods before you conduct the survey. You should also obtain the recommended publications to assist you and your consultant demographer to collect, analyse and interpret these findings. It is important to note that if a woman has had no live births, the rest of the child mortality module and the next two modules are skipped over and the interviewer goes on to the Marriage/Union module. If she has ever had a live birth, the interviewer goes on to administer the entire Child Mortality module. The information from this module is combined with information on her age to make the estimates. \r\n\r\nThe final segment of this module (CM11-12) inquires about live births within the past 2 years and has to be retained (along with CM1), even if the Child Mortality module is omitted, to determine eligibility for the Tetanus Toxoid module and the Maternal and Newborn Health module.", "quality_control":"", "notes":"", "published":0, "weight":1309, "created":"", "changed":""},

The purpose of this module is to obtain information to help programme managers and policy makers plan more effective programmes to prevent the spread of HIV. \r\n\r\nThe module is meant to be used in all countries, but there are notes on the questionnaire showing where and how several questions may need to be adapted locally. The wording of some of these questions has changed slightly since MICS2, because of testing and refinement in measuring key knowledge and stigma indicators by UNAIDS. For countries where injecting drug use is a common means of HIV transmission, an additional question about knowledge of this mode of transmission is provided in the module. \r\n\r\nThe questions and the indicators that can be constructed from the data they provide were developed by UNAIDS and partners. They are part of a set of indicators used to help monitor changes in knowledge, attitudes and practices that are being promoted in HIV prevention programmes around the world. First, questions are asked to determine the respondent\u2019s basic knowledge about HIV transmission. Questions are asked about ways to avoid HIV infection and to assess the prevalence of misconceptions about how HIV is transmitted. Three questions aim to determine whether a woman knows that the AIDS virus can be transmitted from mother to child. Negative attitudes and discrimination against persons living with HIV affect efforts to prevent transmission and to care for infected individuals. Several questions are asked to obtain information about discriminatory attitudes and practices. The purpose of the last four questions is to obtain information about the level of unmet need for HIV testing. They first ask about experience of HIV testing. Voluntary testing and counselling are now encouraged, in the belief that if a person knows his or her HIV status, he or she is more likely to adopt behaviours to prevent contracting the virus or, if positive, of transmitting it. Many of those who do get tested do not return to learn the results, but the proportion of those who do return should rise as the quality of pre-test counselling improves. To monitor the level of demand for such services, a question is included to obtain an estimate of the number of those tested who return to learn the result. A question to determine whether a woman requested the test or was required to take it is also included in MICS3. Finally, for those who have not previously been tested, respondents are asked if they know of a place where an HIV test can be performed. As with all the modules in this questionnaire, it is important that interviewers administer this module with care. It is especially important that they be trained to read out each question in this module exactly as it is written, and to ask questions in the order in which they appear.

One of the main aims was to maintain continuity with the established indicators used during the 1990s to track progress related to the World Summit for Children, as well as to harmonize the indicators with those already agreed upon by the international community, including those used in the MDGs. \r\n\r\nFor MICS3, this revised module incorporates almost all of the questions about diarrhoea treatment that were contained in the earlier MICS questionnaires. The questions ask about drinking and eating patterns during episodes of diarrhoea in the 2 weeks prior to the survey. A new indicator was agreed upon and has been added for oral rehydration therapy (ORT), which combines indicators on oral rehydration and home management of diarrhoea: \u2018ORT or increased fluids AND continued feeding received\u2019. Questions CA6-7 aim to identify a case of suspected pneumonia or other acute respiratory infection needing assessment by an appropriate health provider (as defined by WHO/UNICEF). The questions are limited to illness episodes that occurred in the 2 weeks prior to the survey. \r\n\r\nFor survey identification, the World Health Organization defines these suspected cases of pneumonia as children reported to have had an illness with a cough accompanied by fast and/or difficult breathing. A second question is used to filter out simple cases of a cold with a blocked nose: \u201cWere/are these symptoms due to a problem in the chest or a blocked nose?\u201d If a local term for \u2018rapid breathing\u2019 exists, using that term may be the simplest way to obtain cases of acute lower respiratory tract infection that should be seen by a health care provider. Questions CA8-9 ask whether the caretaker sought care outside the household, and if so, where. The definition of \u2018appropriate health care provider\u2019 is usually agreed upon at the country level. A key strategy for reducing the number of suspected cases of pneumonia is prompt treatment with an appropriate antibiotic. For this reason, questions are also added to the MICS3 questionnaire to assess whether the child with suspected pneumonia was treated with an antibiotic. Improper disposal of the faeces of young children poses a risk of diarrhoeal disease. A specific question has been included in the Questionnaire for Children Under Five to provide information about disposing of the waste of young children in the household (CA12). Finally, question CA13 asks caretakers to name the signs of serious illness that would prompt them to seek immediate treatment for the child at a health facility. Parents or caretakers should be able to name at least two signs of serious illness. Some common responses are provided in the list. Other responses are also recorded.

If both vaccines are in use, retain both items. \r\n\r\nOther antigens may also be used in national immunization programmes, and several possible ones are also listed in the model questionnaire. Remove any that do not appear on vaccination cards and are not in use in your country. \r\nEXAMPLE: Measles vaccine is normally given as an injection in the arm at the age of 9 months. In some countries, measles vaccine is now given at 12 months or 15 or 18 months. \r\n\r\nIn some countries, children may receive the vaccine as an injection in the thigh. Question IM17 will need to be adapted to reflect the usual age recommended for measles vaccine. Vitamin A doses are now sometimes included on a child\u2019s vaccination card, especially if the supplements are delivered in routine child health clinic visits. We have included space for recording the dates of the two most recent doses of vitamin A, if recorded on your country\u2019s vaccination cards. If routine doses of vitamin A are indicated on vaccination cards in your country, you will be able to make some assessment of the regularity of dosing. Correct dosing is an important component of supplementation programmes, because children who are deficient in vitamin A need to receive supplements every 4 to 6 months \u2013 at least twice a year. A question is also included that asks if any doses not shown on the card were given to the child, including vaccines received during a National Immunization Day. This includes campaigns that provide vaccines other than polio, such as measles immunization campaigns. In some countries, vaccination cards are kept at health centres and are not given to mothers. In these countries, an additional page identical to the first page of the Immunization module in the questionnaire should be produced, and if necessary, health centres should be visited to record information from the child\u2019s health card. \r\n\r\nThe module should be used in its entirety during the interview, however. When no vaccination card is available, the caretaker is asked a series of probing questions (IM10-18) to ascertain the type of vaccine and the number of doses, or additional doses received. Lastly, participation in National Immunization Days can be obtained by inserting the dates of the most recent national campaigns (including non-polio campaigns and \u2018vitamin A days\u2019) in IM19 of the module. If possible, include the season of each campaign to help jog the memory of caretakers who cannot recall specific dates.

One of the three key strategies for combating malaria identified by the Roll Back Malaria Partnership is vector control through insecticide-treated mosquito nets (ITNs). Nets used for sleeping that have been treated with an insecticide to repel or kill mosquitoes can substantially reduce malaria transmission, and programmes to provide access to ITNs are under way in many countries. \r\n\r\nThis module provides questions to measure a key indicator, \u2018proportion of households that possess at least one ITN\u2019. The Roll Back Malaria Partnership considers malaria to be endemic in 106 countries. Some of those countries report that no transmission is currently occurring, or very few cases, and the use of this module is not appropriate in those countries. However, in areas at risk of malaria and in malaria-endemic countries where malaria transmission is known to be occurring, this module (and two additional malaria modules for women and children under five) should be included in the questionnaire. \r\n\r\nA net treated with insecticide is effective in repelling or killing mosquitoes before they have the chance to bite. Various types of nets can be purchased. \u2018Long-lasting Insecticidal Nets\u2019 are ready-to-use, factory-pretreated nets that require no further treatment for 4 to 5 years. Efforts are now being made to scale up their production. Other types of nets require treatment with an insecticide every 6 to12 months. These nets can be purchased already pre-treated with an insecticide or untreated, and can be treated or re-treated later. \r\n\r\nIf you plan to include the malaria modules in MICS, you should contact the national malaria control programme in your country to obtain information on the different brands of nets used in the country. Survey coordinators must work closely with knowledgeable professionals in the national malaria control programme to identify all brands of treated mosquito nets that are available in the country, as well as prevention and treatment policies (covered in the other two malaria modules, for women and children under five). \r\n\r\nThis module contains questions to identify if a household possesses at least one insecticidetreated mosquito net. This is accomplished by using questions about the brands of treated and untreated nets available in the household, the length of time that the household has owned a pretreated net, and, if applicable, when the most recent treatment of a net occurred. Sometimes respondents do not know the brand name of the net or nets the household owns, and interviewers may attempt to examine the net to identify the brand. It is often difficult to actually observe nets used for sleeping, because families are concerned about the privacy of their sleeping quarters. In this case, the interviewer may try to identify the brand of net using pictorial aids. Survey coordinators will need to arrange to have photographs of each brand\u2019s logo, if there is one, or the packaging in which the treated nets are sold to help with identification.

The options include both anti-fever medications (antipyretics) such as paracetemol, and antimalarials. \r\n\r\nThe list of antimalarials must be formulated at country level, and country coordinators should work closely with the national malaria control programme to decide which malaria medicines are available and should be listed in the questionnaire.

One of the reasons for this increased risk is that young people often do not have the information or the skills they need to protect themselves. Prevention programmes aim at persuading young women to delay their first sexual experience, to restrict the number of partners they have, and to use condoms with their partner each time they have sex. \r\n\r\nIn MICS3, a module is included to help countries obtain better information to develop or improve HIV prevention programmes for young people. This module, administered only to women aged 15 to 24 years (regardless of marital status), is designed to obtain information about young women\u2019s sexual behaviour. It is extremely important that your interviewers ensure absolute privacy when administering this module. It is also important that the women consent to answering these questions. It must be clear to every woman interviewed that she is free to refuse to respond to these questions if she is uncomfortable answering them. Special care must be taken to train interviewers (who must be female) to administer this module, so that their assurance to the woman that her answers are completely confidential can, in fact, be realized. In some countries, the survey coordinators may feel that the questions on sexual behaviour are too sensitive to be included in a general household survey. \r\n\r\nIf survey coordinators are concerned that including this module will jeopardize the quality of data gathered in other MICS modules, or that the interviewers will not be able to ask these questions easily, do not include this module. In some countries, you may decide to obtain parental consent before administering the questionnaire to women under age 18. Survey coordinators and the MICS3 national steering committees must decide if the module is suitable for inclusion. \r\n\r\nThe module begins with questions about the respondent\u2019s first experience of sexual intercourse, which is used to measure the prevalence of women having sex before age 15. This is followed by questions concerning the relationship she had to the man with whom she last had sex and condom use at that time. The prevalence of \u2018high-risk\u2019 sex among young women is measured as the proportion of these women who had sex with a partner to whom they were not married or cohabiting with. \r\n\r\nAn important indicator for programmes is the proportion of these women who used a condom when having \u2018high-risk\u2019 sex. This is a Millennium Development Goal indicator. Sex between young women and older men can be especially risky since young women often lack the skills to effectively negotiate safe sex. Moreover, older men are more likely than younger men to be infected with HIV, because they have presumably been sexually active for a longer period of time. \r\n\r\nThe module contains questions about the age of a woman\u2019s last sexual partner, even if she does not know his exact age, in order to estimate the extent of \u2018age-mixing\u2019 in sexual relationships. As women better understand the risks, changes in their behaviour will be reflected in this indicator.

Family-support interventions designed to teach parents to use non-violent, non-abusive methods of discipline have been effective in reducing maltreatment of children and improving family functioning. \r\n\r\nDocumentation of child maltreatment is an important step towards implementing programmes to reduce family violence, but information from a wide range of countries about parental disciplinary practices is extremely limited. Data from large population-based sample surveys, which can be compared internationally, are scarcer still. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of this module is to obtain information to assess the use of a variety of physical and verbal ways of disciplining children. The questions were adapted from the Parent-Child Conflict Tactics Scale (CTS-PC) \u2013 an epidemiological instrument widely used to assess the treatment of children \u2013 and are based on the WorldSAFE survey questionnaire, which has been used in developing countries to assess family violence. \r\n\r\nThis module, like the CTS-PC, includes items to measure a range of responses, from non-violent forms of discipline to psychological aggression to severe physical means of disciplining and punishing children. The scale has been tested in different parts of the world and found to provide valid results when careful field procedures are followed.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nGENERAL NOTES\r\n\r\nCHILDREN AGED 2-14 YEARS ELIGIBLE FOR CHILD DISCIPLINE QUESTIONS:\r\nReview the household listing and list each of the children aged 2-14 years below in order according to their line number (HL1). Do not include other household members outside of the age range 2-14 years. Record the line number, name, sex, age, and the line number of the mother or caretaker for each child. Then record the total number of children aged 2-14 in the box provided (CD7).\r\n\r\nIf there is only one child age 2-14 years in the household, then skip table 2 and go to CD9; write down the rank number of the child and continue with CD11.\r\n\r\nSELECTION OF RANDOM CHILD FOR CHILD DISCIPLINE QUESTIONS:\r\nUse this table to select one child between the ages of 2 and 14 years, if there is more than one child in that age range in the household. Look for the last digit of the household number from the cover page. This is the number of the row you should go to in the table below. Check the total number of eligible children (2-14) in CD7 above. This is the number of the column you should go to. Find the box where the row and the column meet and circle the number that appears in the box. This is the rank number of the child about whom the questions will be asked. Record the rank number in CD9 below. Finally, record the line number and name of the selected child in CD11 on the next page.

In many \u2013 if not most \u2013 countries, the problem of domestic violence is a hidden one.

 {"id":1337, "alternate_id":"ID_635010142491678822", "name":"MICS 3 - Child Development", "description":"A young child\u2019s readiness for formal schooling depends very much on a family environment that encourages the child\u2019s learning and development. It is now well recognized that a period of rapid brain development occurs in the first 3 to 4 years of life \u2013 and the quality of the home environment is the major factor determining the child\u2019s development during this period. \r\n\r\nMany studies in different parts of the world have shown that children from homes where they are exposed to a variety of learning experiences and learning materials are more likely to be successful in their early schooling than children who lack these experiences. Moreover, it has also been shown that it is possible to encourage and support parents\u2019 efforts to provide such experiences for their young children through appropriate intervention strategies. \r\n\r\nThe information provided in this module will allow you to estimate the amount of developmentally stimulating activity that the child is engaged in. Several items in this module are components of the Home Scale, which was developed to measure support for learning in the household. The results can be used to evaluate the adequacy of the young child\u2019s learning environment in the home. \r\n\r\nThe data from this module should be useful in monitoring UNICEF\u2019s major new effort to put books into the hands of young children around the world. An association has been found between having books in the household, including children\u2019s books, and stunting, vocabulary scores and the measure of a child\u2019s IQ. Exposure to books in the early years not only provides the child with greater understanding of the nature of print, but may also give the child opportunities to see others reading, such as older siblings doing school work. It is a simple measure to include and is important for later school performance. \r\n\r\nThe module includes questions on the variety and complexity of the child\u2019s play materials. Young children learn by manipulating objects \u2013 testing relationships, sequences and developing a sense of roles and functions in society. They imitate the activities of adults with things, learn social interactions, and keep working on problems (like how to make a simple car) until they can master them. Learning materials need not be purchased. Children enjoy not only store-bought items, but also objects from the household and outside the home. In fact, having learning materials made by family members is more likely to be predictive of later school performance, since it may tell us that the household has a greater recognition of the child\u2019s right to play, and makes a special effort to see that this right is exercised. These home-made toys require no money, but may involve skill and time \u2013 such as a ball made out of banana leaves or a doll from sticks tied together. Poverty probably reduces the number and availability of toys, time to play with them, and the child\u2019s energy to engage with the materials. Conversely, these activities can reduce the effects of poverty on children. \r\n\r\nThe module is also designed to collect information on two measures of potentially unsafe caregiving environments: children left alone, and children left in the care of young caregivers when their mothers are out. There is evidence that these potentially risky care situations may have less positive outcomes than when children are left with more mature caregivers, and are probably associated with an increase in accidents.", "quality_control":"", "notes":"", "published":0, "weight":1337, "created":"", "changed":""},
 {"id":1338, "alternate_id":"ID_635010142807978822", "name":"MICS 3 - Disability", "description":"For many years there has been strong international interest in obtaining good estimates of the prevalence of disability, particularly childhood disability. Such estimates would provide excellent support for advocacy efforts on behalf of disabled children. \r\n\r\nThe questions found in this module provide a simple screening test for children with disabilities. This screening instrument, the \u2018Ten Questions\u2019, is fairly easy to administer and has performed well in three different cultural settings to identify potential \u2018cases\u2019 of childhood disability. Though the estimated sensitivity of the test (its ability to detect cases and not miss children later found to have a disability) is high and uniform across different conditions, the specificity of the test (its ability to exclude false positive cases \u2013 those children later found on examination not to have a disability) varies considerably by type of disability and among populations. These differences may stem from differences in parental perceptions, in the number of children actually attending school, and even differences in survival of seriously disabled children. This does not invalidate the usefulness of the Ten Questions as a screening device, but does mean that it should not be used to measure even potential prevalence of disability cross-culturally. \r\n\r\nThe screening test should be followed by a second-stage study in which children identified as disabled, and a random sample of children who were screened and identified as not having a disability, undergo clinical evaluation. The results of the clinical evaluations will identify cases of disability (1) for estimating overall prevalence of serious disability and (2) to identify children in need of referral to community-based rehabilitation services. \r\n\r\nSurvey coordinators wishing to include this module to obtain information about childhood disabilities should consult the references listed (and posted on the World Wide Web at: http://www.childinfo.org). The follow-up evaluation of cases identified by screening to determine actual cases of disability must be done by a qualified clinician. Only then can a valid estimate of the prevalence of various types of disability be made. Please note: Vision and hearing disabilities must be assessed by another method. The \u2018Ten Questions\u2019 instrument does not provide a sensitive screening for these types of disabilities.", "quality_control":"", "notes":"", "published":0, "weight":1338, "created":"", "changed":""},
 {"id":1339, "alternate_id":"ID_635010143166278822", "name":"MICS 3 - Maternal Mortality", "description":"An optional module is provided for those countries wanting to estimate the maternal mortality ratio. The MICS3 module is unchanged from MICS2, and uses the indirect \u2018Sisterhood\u2019 method, which relies on a simple set of questions posed to all adults about the survival of their sisters. \r\n\r\nAs simple as these questions are, measuring maternal mortality poses considerable difficulty. Because maternal deaths are rare events, even in countries with very high risk, large samples are usually required. Even with very large surveys it is difficult to estimate time trends in maternal mortality. Furthermore, maternal mortality is usually underreported. The estimates generated by the measurement techniques currently available are too imprecise to permit meaningful monitoring of maternal mortality over time. Countries should not attempt to measure the maternal mortality ratio more often than every 10 years or so. \r\n\r\nIn the short term, indicators of health service use and quality of care are preferred for monitoring progress towards the MDGs. \r\nEXAMPLE: The care a woman receives at the time of delivery is linked to improved health outcomes. \r\n\r\nAttendance at delivery by skilled health personnel can be used as a proxy indicator of the impact of programmes to reduce maternal mortality. This indicator is measured in the MICS3 questionnaire. The sisterhood method is not appropriate for use in countries likely to have a low maternal mortality ratio or where fertility is very low. It is also important to mention here that the sisterhood method used in MICS3 is an indirect method, which produces estimates centred on 10 to 12 years before the survey is carried out, an issue that countries should evaluate in regard to the usefulness of maternal mortality estimates. \r\n\r\nIf administered, the module is placed in the household questionnaire and all adults are target respondents for the questions. The main advantage is that each household is likely to have more than one adult respondent, each with different siblings.

In that sense social capital is closely related to what some have called \u201ccivic virtue.\u201d The difference is that \u201csocial capital\u201d calls attention to the fact that civic virtue is most powerful when embedded in a sense network of reciprocal social relations.

The assumption is that certain types of drinking-water sources are likely to deliver drinking-water of adequate quality for their basic health needs. This approximation is used because it would be too costly and time consuming to assess drinking-water quality through national household surveys.\n\nQuestion 1A is designed for households that use bottled water as their main source of drinking-water. In such cases, additional information must be obtained about the water source for other domestic purposes, such as cooking and hand-washing. Bottled water is considered an improved source of drinking-water only when the household uses an improved water source for their other domestic uses.\n\nThe harmonized question set includes a question to determine if the round-trip water hauling time between the household and the water source takes more than 30 minutes. \n\nSeveral other factors, in addition to the quantity of water available and the time and distance to the source, affect the quality of the access that a household has to drinking-water. Such factors include the quality of the water delivered, the continuity of the drinking-water service, the seasonal availability of water, and the affordability of the services. The time needed to haul water (Question 2) and who within the household collects the water (Question 3) can be relatively easily assessed by national household surveys. This is not the case for continuity, reliability, seasonality and affordability of water supplies, since the assessments require too many questions, and these factors are best assessed by surveys dealing exclusively with drinking-water, sanitation and hygiene issues.\n\nHousehold water treatment (Questions 4 and 5) can signifi cantly impact the quality of water at the point of use. Appropriate household treatment involves any method proven to be effective in removing or killing pathogens, such as boiling the water, adding bleach or chlorine to the water, using a water-fi ltering device, solar disinfection of the water and settling methods. Some of these treatments are used individually, but some are combined to ensure that the pathogens are effectively inactivated.", "quality_control":"", "notes":"", "published":1, "weight":1407, "created":"", "changed":""},

A ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrine, pit latrines with the pit well covered by a slab, or composting toilets are also considered improved. Open pits or latrines without a proper slab to cover the pit are considered to be unimproved. Hanging latrines, which deposit untreated excreta directly into bodies of water or in the open, are also unimproved as there is a high risk that individuals could come into direct contact with human excreta.\r\n\r\nQuestions 6 and 7 determine whether a sanitation facility is shared with other households, and if so with how many (Question 8). If a facility is shared and poorly maintained, this can undercut the hygienic quality of the facility and discourage people from using it. Such facilities pose health hazards by exposing people directly to human excreta, but in densely populated urban areas, shared or public facilities are often the only sanitation alternative. \r\n\r\nQuestion 9 deals with the disposal of children\u2019s faeces because this is a critical aspect of sanitary behaviour.

A person could be in or on a vehicle that collides with another vehicle or object, they could fall off of a moving vehicle or bicycle, or they could be standing or walking near the road and could be hit by a vehicle.\nTo respond to this set of questions either of the following conditions must be met:\n1. the RTA will have resulted in the death of someone who was a usual member of the household at the time of the accident; or\n2. the RTA will have resulted in an injury in someone who was a usual member of the household at the time of the accident severe enough that for at least one day they could not carry out their normal daily activities.\n\nIf an injury was very minor and the injury did not prevent the person from performing all of their normal activities, it would not be counted here.\n\nOTHER ACCIDENTS OR INCIDENTS THAT RESULTED IN DEATH OR INJURY, (NOT INCLUDING ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS) (Qs. A14 - A26)\n\nQs. A14 - A26 are very similar to Qs. A01 - A13 except these questions ask about other incidents besides RTAs causing death or injury. Examples may include violence, assault, fire, burning, animal bite, falling, drowning, poisoning, or any other incident that caused a death or an injury severe enough that the person could not perform their daily activities for at least one day. Again, questions pertain to current usual residents of the household and to people who were usual residents of the household in the previous 12 months (they may have since died or moved out of the household).

This calculation can be made to check that the brothers and sisters were recorded in the right order.\n4) If in Q. MM18 (age at death), the respondent tells you she doesn\u2019t know, persist to obtain an estimate. It is preferable to obtain an approximate age than no age at all. However, if the brother or sister died when he/she was still very young, record \u201800\u2019 for age.\n5) Compare the age of the brothers/sisters. Suppose a woman has a first child at the age of 15 and the last at the age of 47, which is an extreme case, the range between the age of the youngest brother or sister and the eldest brother/sister cannot exceed 47-15 = 32 years.\n\nCross check to see if the interval between brothers/sisters is very long (5 years and above).

Disability is impossible to describe in one or two sentences, partly because it covers a huge range of things and also touches a large number of people. It is likely to affect everyone at some stage in their lives. Generally, a disability is inability or great difficulty in performing one or more major life activities in the person\u2019s current social environment, either because of a physical, mental, or psychological illness, or an impairment with any part of the body, such as a missing, or damaged part of the body.\n\nMajor life activities include the following:\n* Having a full range of movement while standing, lifting, walking and so forth,\n* Having intact senses (vision, hearing, touch, smell, taste, balance),\n* Communicating with others (speaking and writing),\n* Learning and working,\n* Caring for oneself in hygiene and homemaking,\n* Using mental processes such as thinking, concentrating, and problem solving,\n* Interacting with others and developing and maintaining relationships.\n\nQuestions 26 through 35 are designed to be inserted to Household Schedule module in the Household Questionnaire. \nThey asked for each household member and visitor who spent the night before the survey (column 5 and/or column 6 = YES) and who are age 5 and older. The questions ask about difficulty with vision, hearing, communicating/understanding, memory or concentration, walking, and the capacity to undertake basic activities such as washing or dressing. If a person is experiencing difficulty in any of the areas, information is sought about the degree of difficulty that he/she has.\n\nHaving difficulty with an activity means:\n\u2022 Being unable to perform the function\n\u2022 Increased effort to perform the function\n\u2022 Discomfort or pain when performing the function\n\u2022 Slowness in performing the function\n\nThe answer categories are set up so that the respondent can indicate the level of difficulty.\n1.

As cells become more and more abnormal, old or damaged cells survive when they should die, and new cells form when they are not needed.
