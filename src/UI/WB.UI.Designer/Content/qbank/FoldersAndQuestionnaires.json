 {"id":348, "alternateId":"Survey_Qbank_MAR2009VG6", "pid":344, "name":"Core Welfare Indicator Questionnaire (CWIQ)", "description":"The Core Welfare Indicators Questionnaire (CWIQ) has been developed by the World Bank and its partners to help provide policy-makers with household level information for policy formulation and evaluation. The CWIQ is intended to monitor poverty and the effects of development policies, programs and projects on living standards. \r\n\r\nTo make useful impact assessments, researchers and policy makers require appropriate indicators of welfare status on different population subgroups. National-level indicators are usually insufficient for planning purposes, and traditional impact indicators that measure changes in welfare status (e.g. percent of the population below the poverty line, number of malnourished children etc.) are expensive and time-consuming to collect. While the periodic collection of such impact indicators is necessary, the CWIQ is intended to be applied frequently (possibly annually), so implementation time needs to be short. \r\n\r\nThe CWIQ employs simple indicators to ultimately identify who is, and who is not, benefiting from various actions designed to improve the social and economic status of the poor. The conceptual framework within which the core list of indicators has been developed is as follows: in order for communities and households to maximize their potential, they need to have access to services and facilities that will help them improve their living standards. The CWIQ therefore focuses on the collection of information to measure peoples\u2019 access, utilization, and satisfaction with key social and economic services. Thus for instance in the case of schooling, the CWIQ asks for: distance to the nearest school (access), number of children enrolled in school by age and gender (utilization), and whether the household is satisfied with the quality of the schooling (satisfaction). \r\n\r\nCWIQ Indicators \r\n\r\nThe indicators available through the CWIQ survey are of two types: i) indicators of standards of living for the household and household members, and ii) indicators of access, utilization, and satisfaction with community and other basic services (amenities, education, health, etc.). \r\n\r\nThe key indicators include: \r\n\r\nIndicators of Living Standards: \r\n- Percent of households reporting diminishing/increasing land assets. \r\n- Home ownership. \r\n- Type of home construction. \r\n- Percent of households using wood, charcoal or crop residues for cooking fuel. \r\n- Type of fuel used for lighting. \r\n- Ownership of selected household goods. \r\n- Mean number of household members. \r\n- Percent of adults who are literate. \r\n- Percent of persons sick or injured in previous four weeks. \r\n- Type of sickness or injury. \r\n- Percent of children who are malnourished. \r\n\r\nAccess, Utilization and Satisfaction Indicators \r\n- Access to clean water. \r\n- Access to primary and secondary schools. \r\n- Access to local market and public transport. \r\n- Net primary and secondary enrollment rates (by gender). \r\n- Satisfaction with school services. \r\n- Percent of children who do not attend school. \r\n- Reasons for not attending school. \r\n- Primary and secondary drop out rates (by gender). \r\n- Access to medical services. \r\n- Use of medical services by persons sick or injured in previous four weeks. \r\n- Satisfaction with local health service. \r\n- Reasons for nonuse of medical services \r\n- Percent of women with a recent birth who received prenatal care. \r\n- Percent of births delivered in a health facility. \r\n- Percent of births supervised by a formally trained health worker. \r\n- Percent of children who have participated in nutrition programs. \r\n- Percent of children who have participated in weigh-in programs. \r\n- Percent of persons currently employed. \r\n- Percent of persons underemployed. \r\n- Percent of persons unemployed during the previous week \r\n\r\nKey Features of the CWIQ Survey\r\n- A national annual survey which is quick and easy to implement \r\n- Rapid monitoring of key indicators for different population subgroups \r\n- Part of an overall monitoring package \r\n- Short questionnaire and single visit \r\n- Multiple choice questions for easy and rapid data collection \r\n- Scannable data entry to eliminate data entry bottlenecks \r\n- Complete validation specifications and programs \r\n- Standard tabulation plan and programs \r\n- Employs as large a sample as is feasible, given national statistical resource constraints, and the need for rapid results \r\n- A national annual survey which is quick and easy to implement \r\n\r\nAll aspects of the CWIQ converge on one goal: to collect accurate welfare data quickly enough to inform program and policy decisions. Measures are taken at every stage of the survey process to reduce time to outputs. \r\n\r\nThe CWIQ makes use of sampling data already available in the country, employs a standardized questionnaire, standardized data entry and presentation of results, all with the aim of reducing the time from initiation of the survey to analysis of the data. \r\n\r\nThe CWIQ is intended to be an annual, nationally representative survey of households. While the number of indicators the CWIQ can measure is limited, it does allow the calculation of indices at a relatively disaggregated level. Comparisons can be made between different population groups across regions. \r\n\r\nThe CWIQ would ideally be part of an overall national monitoring package which could also include focus-group interviews and qualitative studies, panel surveys to monitor income, expenditure and consumption patterns, and periodic (e.g., 5-year) nationwide Integrated Surveys. \r\n\r\nThe CWIQ is deliberately short so that it can be easily administered each year, without causing undue disruption to other survey activities in which the statistical organization may be involved. \r\n\r\nIdeally, the CWIQ would be implemented as a core questionnaire which remains constant, and play host to an accompanying rotating module. The contents of the module would be dictated by special interests of the country, to monitor use, access, and satisfaction for services not included in the core. The questionnaire is very short. It is easily administered and average interview time will only be around half an hour. The interview requires only a single visit to the household, and in most cases can be completed with the assistance of a single household member. Certain parts of the questionnaire collect information on individual household members, others relate to the household as a whole. The questionnaire also includes an anthropometry section which requires the interviewer to measure the height and weight of children under 5 years of age. Interview duration will vary, depending on the number of children to be measured. \r\n\r\nMost of the questions are multiple choice, requiring only a single coded answer. This greatly reduces overall interview time. \r\n\r\nScannable data entry \r\n\r\nWhile survey data are ordinarily entered into computers via keyboard operators, the CWIQ questionnaire is designed to be optically scanned by machine. This greatly reduces the time required for data entry, and also eliminates data entry errors introduced by keyboard entry. The use of scanners does, however, pose certain restrictions on the type and length of questionnaire that can be used. For instance, open-ended questions and questions which cannot be pre-coded cannot be processed. Scannable questionnaire forms must also be carefully handled and filled in, and need to be printed with great accuracy in order to minimize the chance of misreading during scanning. \r\n\r\nProcessing of the data includes a range of validation and consistency checks that are carried out on the data to ensure that data quality is of the highest order. \r\n\r\nStandardizing the presentation of results greatly decreases the time between data collection and data presentation, making the results of the CWIQ ever more useful to both program monitoring and policy evaluation. Reports will be accurate and allow the data to be easily digested. \r\n\r\nSample sizes must meet some minimal requirements in order to obtain reliable estimates. For example, a country desiring regional-level estimates would, as a rough rule of thumb, need to sample at least 30 clusters per region (the number of regions in a country may vary roughly from 10 to 30 regions). In addition, there should be a minimum of 10 households selected per cluster. Therefore, a country with 10 regions would need to have a minimum sample size of 3000 households to obtain regional level estimates (10 regions x 30 clusters x 10 households per cluster = 3000). Sample sizes quickly mount up as the level of disaggregation increases. A country with 30 districts or zones wanting district level estimates would need a total sample size of at least 9,000 households. \r\n\r\nCWIQ Limitations \r\n\r\nThe unique value of the CWIQ lies in its ability to provide rapid information on key indicators for policy target groups. The CWIQ can do this because of its design as an \"off-the-shelf\" product. Meaning, it does not require changes, and is ready to be fielded in its present condition. The resulting limitation is the necessity for implementing organizations to withstand inevitable pressures to add or change questions, in order not to jeopardize the CWIQ\u2019s main objective of providing rapid results. While it is always tempting to expand the content of a questionnaire going into the field, any such changes will significantly delay the processing of results, as all changes to the questionnaire require data processing programs to be adapted accordingly. \r\n\r\nWhile the CWIQ does collect a wealth of information, there exist a number of household welfare issues that it does not address. The CWIQ is not a survey to measure household income or expenditures. It cannot capture the intricacies of intra-household relations or the contributions by different members of the household to income or welfare. It does not address questions of seasonality or migration, nor detail the composition and production of agricultural holdings or other enterprises. \r\n\r\nIn order to overcome the limitation imposed by the relatively inflexible design of the CWIQ, and to meet the requirements of individual country needs, a distinction is made between the \"core\" questionnaire, which is relatively fixed, and \"modules\", which can be much more flexible. The appropriate vehicle for adapting the CWIQ core questionnaire to country-specific circumstances is the module. Modules can be designed to supplement the information collected in the core. Fielding of modules can be done using the same enumerators, and the same sample. However, modules should normally be conducted as a separate activity, at some time after processing of the CWIQ has been completed, so as not to delay the processing and analysis of the core data. \r\n\r\nA CWIQ survey timeline has been developed for countries or agencies proposing to implement a CWIQ. The project begins with the implementation of a one month pilot survey. The pilot is the vehicle through which on or two consultants will work with the implementing agency to demonstrate the methodology of the CWIQ. A small, (non-representative) sample of about 1,000 households is enumerated, including both urban and rural households. The pilot phase ends with an evaluation workshop to assess the survey experience and establish a timetable for the national survey. Work on the first national survey begins immediately following the pilot. The first phase of the national survey is the preparation phase-- a period of approximately six months to prepare for the fielding of the survey. During this time equipment is procured, survey logistics are planned, the sample is selected, questionnaires and manuals are printed, data processing procedures and programs are prepared and finalized, and field and data processing staff are recruited and trained. The second phase of the national survey is the period of time in which the survey is in the field, usually spanning no more than three months. Data entry runs in parallel with fieldwork; questionnaires are scanned as they are returned from the field. Thus, the bulk of data entry is done while the survey is still in the field, requiring only a few days beyond the completion of fieldwork to enter the last of the interviews. The final phase of the main survey is comprised of data analysis and production of a report. The data processing team will be able to complete their tasks within a short time of the completion of data collection (entering the last questionnaires, completing data validation, etc.) and produce the tables designed for the summary report. The report should be completed within approximately two months of the end of fieldwork. Results should be presented at a national seminar to discuss and demonstrate their value for policy and project design. In sum, the first implementation of the CWIQ (including demonstration and pilot) may require about 12 months of time to completion: one month for the pilot, six months in preparing for data collection and entry, three months for data collection and entry, and two months for preparation of a report. As experience is gained with the survey, subsequent rounds of the CWIQ are likely to be conducted within an elapsed time period of 2 to 4 months. \r\n\r\nOutputs \r\n\r\nThe CWIQ is intended to generate information as quickly as possible. To meet this goal, a standard tabulation plan has been designed to present key survey results. The tabulation plan includes: (1) tables that are standardized to form the basis of a report-- the standard report tables; and (2) the data processing programs used to produce them. It is not intended that presentation and use of the CWIQ data be delayed by the production of a voluminous statistical report. The standard tabulation plan has been designed to ensure that survey results can be presented within one or two months of the conclusion of fieldwork. \r\nThe tabulation plan encompasses all topics for which data are collected in the CWIQ: \r\n- General results \r\n- Household situation and characteristics \r\n- Education \r\n- Health \r\n- Nutrition \r\n- Employment \r\n\r\nThe standard report tables also present welfare indices for the main subgroups of interest: \r\n- Poverty quintiles (households are categorized into one of five levels of poverty, ranging from the poor to the non-poor) \r\n- Rural/urban residence \r\n- Geographic (administrative) regions \r\n- Socioeconomic groups (occupation of head of household)", "notes":"", "published":1, "weight":348},

Much of the analysis undertaken using LSMS surveys attempts to investigate the determinants of living standards\u2014which requires more sophisticated analytical methods than simple descriptive tables.\r\n\r\nLSMS surveys have several characteristics that distinguish them from other surveys. One of the most important is that they use several questionnaires to collect information about many different aspects of household welfare and behavior.These consist of a household questionnaire, a community questionnaire, a price questionnaire, and, in some cases, a facilities questionnaire. \r\n\r\nAnother characteristic of LSMS surveys is that they typically have nationally representative, but relatively small, samples\u2014usually between 2000 and 5000 households. This will yield fairly accurate descriptive statistics for the country as a whole and for large subareas (such as rural and urban areas or a few agroclimatic zones), but usually not for political jurisdictions (such as states or provinces). The surveys\u2019 sample sizes are generally adequate for the regression methods often used for policy analysis of LSMS survey data.", "notes":"Because of the complexity of most LSMS surveys, these surveys have rigorous quality control procedures to ensure that the data they gather are of high quality. These procedures, which are generally difficult to implement on larger samples, usually include several key elements. Both the survey\u2019s fieldwork and its data entry are decentralized, and the people who carry out these tasks are strictly supervised. Interviewers receive extensive training (usually for about four weeks) prior to the survey. In the field, information is gathered not by asking one person all the questions about the household and its members but through a series of \u201cmini-interviews,\u201d with each adult responding for himself or herself. This procedure minimizes any errors caused by respondent fatigue or by the use of proxy respondents .The interviewers make multiple visits to households to find any members who were not home during the interviewer\u2019s earlier visits\u2014which also reduces the need to use proxy respondents.\r\n\r\nThere is one supervisor for every two or three interviewers. The supervisors must revisit a significant percentage (often 25 percent) of the sampled households to check on the accuracy of the interviewer\u2019s data.They must directly observe some interviews, and they must review each questionnaire in detail. Supervisors\u2019 performance of these procedures is documented, and the supervisors are in turn supervised by staff from the central office of the statistical agency. Data entry and editing are done as soon as each interview is over, either in the local field office or by a data entry operator who travels to households with the team of interviewers. As data are entered into the computer, a data entry program carries out a large number of quality checks to detect responses that are out of range or inconsistent with the other data from the questionnaire.

It is also useful to have two extra columns immediately to the left of Questions A1 and A2 that can be sued to write each person's age (in years) and indicate whether the person is a household member.

The modules also contain a draft questionnaire for local schools and a draft questionnaire for the teachers in those schools.\r\n\r\nThe short module for the household questionnaire consists of a single page of only 11 questions.  The standard module is much longer. It is divided into four parts, A, B, C, and D. The expanded module takes the standard module as its starting point and adds additional questions to Part B. If the short module is used, neither the school questionnaire nor the teacher questionnaire should be included in the survey. When the standard module is used, it is often useful to add the school questionnaire. The expanded module should include both the school questionnaire and the teacher questionnaire. This is explained in detail in Chapter 7 of the LSMS Manual. \r\n\r\nThe standard education module is designed to gather the information needed to answer most of the policy questions discussed in this chapter. It is therefore designed to allow researchers to investigate not only the impact of education on other socioeconomic outcomes but also the determinants of most educational outcomes. The main omission from this module is that no effort is made to collect detailed information on cognitive skills. \r\n\r\n Before discussing this module in detail, several general points need to be made. First, a cursory glance suggests that this module is substantially longer than the standard education modules used in full LSMS surveys in the late 1980s and early 1990s. This appearance is deceptive. The main reason there are more questions is that people who have already finished their schooling answer a set of questions that is different from the questions answered by people currently in school. The former answer Questions 7-24 of Part A while the latter answer Questions 25-40. Having  these two sets of people answer different questions should make the interview go easier; in particular, it should avoid any confusion about whether the grade indicated for a person still in school is the current grade or the \"highest grade completed,\" which, technically speaking, is the previous grade. On the other hand, there are a few additional questions on repetition, and Part D  is completely new. However, some questions have also been deleted, and Part D has to be filled out only once for the entire household rather  than once for each individual (and households that contain no school-age children do not fill it out at all). Overall, there is a small increase in the number of questions asked but this increase is not nearly as great as initial appearances may suggest.\r\n\r\nAnother general point is that one may want to add a few qualitative questions asking households why they made the schooling decisions they did. While some might argue that these explanations are rationalizations and thus are not very accurate, others may find such information interesting, if for no other reason than to see what households claim- are the reasons for the choices they have made. In particular, a question could be inserted after Question 5 in Part A asking: \"Why have you never attended school?\" Possible reasons are the same ones given for nonattendance in the education module of the community questionnaire (see Chapter 13). It may only be useful to ask this question for relatively young individuals. A similar question could be added after Question 6 of Part A: \"Why are you no longer attending school?\"Again, this may only be appropriate for younger individuals. A third place to ask a qualitative question is immediately after Question 30 of Part A; for persons who were absent from school in some of the past seven days one could ask: \"Why were you absent from school during the past seven days?\"    \r\n                            \r\nA third general point is that any survey that uses the standard version of the education module should also collect anthropometric data, since there is strong evidence that early childhood nutrition affects educational outcomes. The collection of anthropometric data is discussed in Chapter 10. \r\n\r\nA final point is that two school questionnaires -the  questionnaire for administrators and the questionnaire for teachers- could be used with the standard module. This is not necessary, but it will increase substantially the range of issues that can be analyzed.", "notes":"There are two aspects that need particular attention when designing the education module. First, survey designers should consider whether the questions in Part C of the household roster module collect sufficient information on the education for non-resident children of current household members. That module is described in Chapter 6 of Volume 1 of the LSMS Manual.

The short module contains 39 questions and is not divided into different parts. \r\n\r\nThe standard module is divided into six parts: A, B, C, D, E, and F. The average duration of an interview using the standard module should be approximately 5-10 minutes per individual. However, the length of these interviews is likely to vary substantially, since individuals who did not use any health care services during the previous 30 days will be able to skip many of the questions. \r\n\r\nThe expanded module adds questions to parts A and E, and adds two more parts, G and H.

Second, whenever the standard or the expanded health module is used, the survey team supervisor must draw up a master list of codes for all of the health service providers in the community. This list is used to match different information from different parts of the questionnaires. See Chapter 8 of the LSMS Manual for further discussion.\r\n\r\nIf the short module is used, there is no reason to include the health facility questionnaire in the survey.

In particular, a large amount of information on credit should be collected in other modules, such as those on housing, consumption, agriculture and nonagricultural household businesses. Information on credit should also be coordinated with information on savings, which is described in Chapter 20 of Volume 2 of LSMS manual. Finally, information on local credit institutions could be gathered in the community questionnaire. Community data are discussed in detail in Chapter 13 of Volume 1 of LSMS manual.", "notes":"The placement of the credit module in the questionnaire will come from a compromise between two considerations. On the one hand, because credit questions are sensitive, it is better to place the module as late in the interview as possible. The longer the interviewer and the respondent have interacted before the credit questions are administered, the more likely it is that trust will have been established between them-minimizing the likelihood that respondents will refuse to respond or will give interviewers incorrect information. For this reason, in past extreme, collecting no detailed loan information at all, LSMS surveys credit modules have usually been administered last. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, since credit data are collected at the individual level, they need to be collected during the individual-level phase of the interview. During the first round of the survey the interviewer collects information directly from all household members; due to the different schedules of each household member this often requires the interviewer to make a series of visits to the household. Given the importance of getting credit information directly from those who are responsible for that credit, and given the cost involved in interviewing each household member, it is important that whenever possible, all individual level modules are administered in one sitting. This means that the credit module must be administered in the first round. However, within this first round, it is recommended that the credit module be placed directly after the employment module, to take advantage of skip patterns (since the credit module is administered to all people of working age). This is a reasonable compromise as it means that the module will come late in the individual-level interviews while still ensuring that the information is collected from the direct informant.", "published":1, "weight":386},

For further discussion see Chapter 15 of LSMS manual.", "notes":"In most previous LSMS surveys, the fertility module has been administered to women ages 15 to 49 (inclusive). Survey designers can modify these criteria for the fertility module if conditions in the filed allow only married women to be interviewed or if it is clear that there is substantial sexual activity and childbearing among girls younger than 15.  \r\n\r\nIn many previous LSMS surveys the fertility module has been administered to one randomly selected woman of childbearing age in each household. Doing this reduces interview time but also results in women in large households being underrepresented in the resulting data. Alternatively, the fertility module could be administered to all women of childbearing age in a household. To do this, multiple copies of the fertility modules should be included in the questionnaire or additional fertility modules should be made available to interviewers. In practice, interviewing two or three eligible women per household would address sampling considerations and be much simpler than including all eligible women. Survey designers might wish to refer to a recent census to estimate the number of copies of the module that would be required for the average household. \r\n\r\nThe draft module presented in the previous section was designed to be administered to women.

In countries that send large numbers of guest workers overseas, survey designers may want to include the expanded version of the emigration section. They may also wish to include the questions in the expanded module about whether the person ever lived abroad - making it possible for analysts to study the experiences of emigrants who have returned.", "notes":"A \"place\" normally refers to a concentration of dwellings. For migration purposes an entire metropolitan area, including its immediate suburbs, might be considered one place, even though this definition would rule out the possibility of analyzing migration within metropolitan boundaries. Similarly, an entire village (and its associated land area) is normally considered a place. However, where settlement is very diffuse, survey designers will need to define the concept of a place very carefully prior to fielding the migration module; preferably this definition will follow some notion of a community. \r\n\r\nTo analyze place-to-place migration effectively, the place of current residence must be identified as precisely as possible. At the very least, analysts need to know a comparatively small administrative area (such as a district or county) in which the place of interview is located, as well as whether this is an urban or rural place.Without such information, analysts cannot observe patterns of migration among administrative areas or between urban and rural areas. Where confidentiality rules permit, it is desirable for the name of the town or village where the interview was conducted to be revealed. Knowing the town name allows more effective merging of secondary data, more accurate recording of distances, and more detailed examinations of place-to-place migration. In most previous LSMS surveys, it has been possible to release the names of the places where the interviews were conducted. \r\n\r\nThroughout the draft migration module, to \"live\" somewhere means to eat and sleep in this place for three months or more. In some societies people distinguish between \"staying\" in a place-meaning eating and sleeping there-and \"living\" in a place-meaning owing allegiance to that place. In these cases the more appropriate term to use is \"staying.\" \r\n\r\nThe term \"province codes\" is used throughout the draft migration module. These codes should refer to small areas. In some countries \"county\" or \"district\" may be a more appropriate term. Interviewers must be provided with guidelines about what constitutes an \"urban\" area in a country. \r\n\r\n\"Household associates\" are all the living people identified in Section B and C of the household roster: that is, all living parents and children of household members who are not themselves members of the household. The additional questions for household associates should also be asked about a head of household who has been absent for more than three months, even if this person is still considered a household member. If an extended roster is applied-identifying spouses, siblings, or other relatives of household members who are not themselves members-these people should also be included on the list of household associates.The ID number referred to in the associates section of the migration module is the ID number these associates were given in the household roster module.", "published":1, "weight":389},

Survey results from participating countries will be available starting from the end of 2013.\r\n\r\nSince 1995, UNICEF has supported countries for the collection of statistically sound and internationally comparable data through MICS surveys. High quality data on the situation of children and women generated through MICS surveys are essential for developing evidence-based policies and programmes, as well as for monitoring countries\u2019 progress toward national goals and global commitments.\r\n\r\nOver the last 17 years and four rounds of MICS, 240 MICS surveys have been conducted in more than 100 countries.\r\n\r\nCountries will need good quality data for reporting in the context of a number of global initiatives, and MICS data will play a key role in this context.\r\n \r\nThe data generated in the fifth round of MICS surveys (and other nationally representative household surveys) will be critically important for final MDG reporting. MICS surveys will generate data on more than 20 MDG indicators. The United Nations Secretary General\u2019s Final MDG Progress Report will be launched in September 2015. UNICEF and all lead agencies will need to submit vetted data to the UN Statistics Division, which is coordinating the preparation of the report, by March 2015. This means that all country level data from surveys need to be compiled and submitted to respective UN agencies by the summer of 2014, so that all inter-agency estimates can be submitted on time.\r\nAt least 3-4 months are required to produce initial estimates of indicators from household surveys. Therefore, fieldwork (data collection) for MICS surveys that will be conducted specifically for final MDG reporting will need to be completed before the end of 2013 or very early in 2014.\r\n\r\nBeyond final MDG reporting, MICS5 surveys will contribute to the evidence base of other important initiatives. For example, monitoring of under-five mortality levels and key child survival interventions will be a critical component of Committing to Child Survival: A Promise Renewed (http://www.apromiserenewed.org), a global movement to end child deaths from preventable causes. MICS5 surveys will also provide data for tracking progress on the key indicators for the accountability framework proposed by the Commission on Information and Accountability for the Global Strategy for Women\u2019s and Children\u2019s Health (http://www.who.int/woman_child_accountability/en/).\r\n \r\nAs key data sources generating data on equity, MICS will play a key role in tracking progress towards elimination of disparities and inequities.

It is useful if the respondent is also the mother or primary caretaker of children living in this household.\r\n\r\nThe Household Questionnaire begins with a cover page, the \u2018Household Information Panel\u2019, which includes information on the household and should be completed for all sampled households, including those where the interview was not completed. This is followed by the \u2018Household Listing Form\u2019, used to collect information on all usual residents of the household, including their age, sex, and relationship to the household head as well as questions on orphanhood. The \u2018Education\u2019 module includes questions on the educational attainment of household members who are 5 years of age or over, as well as school attendance for household members aged 5-24 years. The subsequent two modules, \u2018Water and Sanitation\u2019 and \u2018Household Characteristics\u2019, concern the household and the dwelling. In malaria-endemic countries, the modules on \u2018Insecticide Treated Nets\u2019 and \u2018Indoor Residual Spraying\u2019 are to be included. The \u2018Child Labour\u2019 module includes questions about work any of the children aged 5-14 years living in the household may do. For the \u2018Child Discipline\u2019 module, if there is more than one children age 2-14 living in the household, only one child is randomly selected with the help of a Kish Table and the module is administered for this selected child. The next module is the \u2018Handwashing\u2019 module that requires the interviewer to do observation of the specific place in the household used for handwashing and the availability of water and soap there. The Household Questionnaire ends with a module on \u2018Salt Iodization\u2019, where the result of salt testing is to be recorded. Salt testing is carried out in all households in the sample and the salt used in the household for cooking is tested for iodine content, by using salt testing kits. MICS Manual Chapter \u2018Salt Iodization Testing\u2019 includes more information about the salt iodization testing.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nGENERAL NOTES\r\n\r\nIn each sampled household an interviewer visits, he/she should begin by interviewing a knowledgeable adult member of the household to fill in the Household Questionnaire. All modules of the Household Questionnaire will be administered to this person, referred to as the Household Respondent, including the module in the questionnaire where the information collected is about other household members (i.e., the educational attainment).\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this questionnaire, an adult is defined as someone age 15 and over. However, young adults (below age 18) may not be the most ideal members to interview. Therefore, in cases when there is another older household member (for instance, the parent of the 15 year-old) available to interview, the interviewer should prefer to interview this person who is likely to be more knowledgeable about the household. Interviewing the household head is not a must and he/she is not required to ask for the household head to do the interview.\r\n\r\nIt is also true that it can be an advantage if the interviewer begins the Household Questionnaire with a mother or primary caretaker, since many of the questions/modules are about children, and mothers/caretaker provide more accurate responses to such questions better than anybody else. While he/she should not make a specific effort to ensure this, he/she will indeed start the interview with such persons in many cases, since, in practice, these persons are more likely to be at home than, say, male household heads.\r\n\r\nThere should only be one respondent to the Household Questionnaire and the other members of the household should not respond to any part of the questionnaire. Ideally, the respondent is also not expected to consult any other members that may be available in the household for some factual questions he or she may not be certain (i.e., age or education of household members). However, if an interviewer thinks that this may seriously affect the flow of the questionnaire(s) he/she may allow the respondent to ask other members in order to get more correct information (such as age information which may affect the eligibility of some members for individual questionnaires or modules where age checks are important (i.e., education or child labour module).\r\n\r\nIf an interviewer visits a household with no members eligible for the individual questionnaires (Questionnaire for Individual Women, Questionnaire for Individual Men and Questionnaire for Children Under Five), he/she must still ask questions about the household to a knowledgeable adult member and complete the Household Questionnaire.\r\n\r\nA supervisor will give an interviewer a list or tell him/her how to find the households to visit. The interviewer must visit all these households and not replace these households with another household that is not selected for interview in that cluster. \r\n\r\nIf no one is at home when an interviewer goes to interview the household, ask the neighbours whether the house is inhabited. If it is occupied, ask the neighbours when the household members will return. Arrange with a supervisor to go back to the dwelling when it will be occupied or at the end of the day. Note those plans on a cluster control sheet and note the time the interviewer returns on the first page of the questionnaire (Household Information Panel). \r\n\r\nIf no adult is at home, arrange to come back at another time. Do not interview a temporary caretaker of the children, such as a babysitter; do not interview anyone who does not usually live in the household.\r\n\r\nEach household in the sample has to be visited at least three times before an interviewer can mark the household as \u2018Not at home\u2019, unless otherwise instructed by a supervisor. There may be cases when he/she learns that the household will be away for an extended period, and will definitely not return within the fieldwork period. In such cases, three visits to the household may not be necessary. However, even in such cases, the ultimate decision will have to be taken by the supervisor. \r\n\r\nAn interviewer should always keep a record on the cluster control sheet of the households visited where nobody was at home. If it is not possible to interview an eligible woman or man, record this on the Woman\u2019s or Man\u2019s Information Panel of the questionnaire. If it is not possible to interview a mother or primary caretaker, record this on the Under Five Child Information Panel of the Questionnaire for Children Under Five.", "notes":"", "published":0, "weight":401},

All modules in this questionnaire are to be completed with the eligible woman. Under no circumstances should a proxy respondent be allowed to respond on behalf of the woman herself.\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, some countries may decide to administer this questionnaire to ever-married women only. In some settings, topics such as contraceptive use or sexual behaviour may be considered inappropriate for women who have never been married for cultural reasons, or the incidence of sexual activity or contraceptive use may be negligible. In such cases, it is possible to collect information on the marital status of women in the Household Listing Form of the Household Questionnaire and modify the eligibility for the women\u2019s questionnaire to \u2018all women aged 15-49 years who have ever been married\u2019. This is not recommended, however, since it introduces a new dimension to the identification of eligible woman, makes analysis more difficult, and relies heavily on the responses from the respondent to the Household Questionnaire for the identification of the respondent. For these reasons, it is preferable to retain the eligibility criteria used in the model questionnaires, but to obtain information on the marital status of the woman in the Questionnaire for Individual Women and use this information to skip questions or modules that may be considered inappropriate. On the other hand, it is worthwhile to mention that, in many settings, never-married respondents are less reluctant to answer sensitive questions than survey administrators think they are. We therefore recommend that a thorough evaluation concerning the applicability of the questions be carried out and perhaps tested during the pre-test exercise, before a decision is made.\r\n\r\nThe Questionnaire for Individual Women begins with the \u2018Woman\u2019s Information Panel\u2019, which includes identification codes for the woman, and then the \u2018Woman\u2019s Background\u2019 module collects information on age, date of birth and literacy of the respondent. The \u2018Access to Mass Media and Use of Information/Communication Technology Module\u2019 module collects information on the exposure of respondents to mass media, and the use of computers and the internet. The module on \u2018Child Mortality\u2019 is used to collect information useful for estimating infant and under-five mortality rates, as well as information on the timing of women\u2019s last birth, if any. This latter information is used to determine whether the woman should respond to questions in the subsequent two modules, on \u2018Desire for Last Birth\u2019 and \u2018Maternal and Newborn Health\u2019, which are applied to all women with a live birth within the 2 years preceding the interview. \u2018Post-natal Health Checks\u2019 module includes questions to measure contact with a health provider at some point after the completion of the delivery process. Following this are three modules administered to all women: \u2018Illness Symptoms\u2019, \u2018Contraception\u2019 and \u2018Unmet Need\u2019. In affected countries, the \u2018Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting\u2019 module should be included followed by \u2018Attitudes towards Domestic Violence\u2019 and \u2018Marriage/Union\u2019 modules. The module on \u2018Sexual Behaviour\u2019 is asked to all women and should be added immediately prior to the \u2018HIV/AIDS\u2019 module. The \u2018Maternal Mortality\u2019 module obtains information about the sex and survivorship of all of a respondent\u2019s siblings. Information is also collected about their current age, age at death, number of years since death and, in the case of deceased sisters, if the death occurred during pregnancy, childbirth or within two months of childbirth. The next module \u2018Tobacco and Alcohol Use\u2019 includes questions on cigarette smoking, use of smoked tobacco products, use of smokeless tobacco products and alcohol use. The last module \u2018Life Satisfaction\u2019 is administered to women age 15-24 years and intends to measure perceived level of well-being and happiness.\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------\r\nGENERAL NOTES\r\n\r\nIf an eligible woman is not available for interview or not at home, ask a family member or neighbour when she will return. Note this on the Woman\u2019s Information Panel, follow the supervisor\u2019s instructions, and return to interview her at that time. Do not take responses for the women\u2019s questionnaire from anyone other than the eligible person herself.\r\n\r\nThis questionnaire should only be administered by a skilled female interviewer.

All of the modules are applicable to all children for whom the questionnaire is administered. The model questionnaire consists of eight standard modules. It begins with the \u2018Under-Five Child Information Panel\u2019 that covers the identification information, and then the \u2018Age\u2019 module includes questions to determine the age and date of birth of the child. This is followed by modules on \u2018Birth Registration\u2019, \u2018Early Childhood Development\u2019, \u2018Breastfeeding\u2019, \u2018Care of Illness\u2019, \u2018Malaria\u2019 (to be included only in malaria-endemic countries) and \u2018Immunization\u2019. The model questionnaire ends with the \u2018Anthropometry\u2019 module, which is used to record the results of anthropometric measurements, that is, heights/lengths and weights of children. Use of standard equipment for this purpose is recommended. More information on anthropometric measurements is presented and the recommended boards and scales are described in MICS Manual Chapter \u2018Preparing for Data Collection and Conducting Fieldwork\u2019. In households where there is more than one child under age five, it is recommended that all measurements be carried out after completing all interviews, for logistical reasons.\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of a separate Questionnaire for Children Under Five in MICS makes it possible to collect data on children whose mothers may have died or are living elsewhere. Such children usually constitute a more vulnerable group and it is important to obtain information on them. In many other similar surveys, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), information on children under five is normally collected only if the mother is interviewed. Identification of a primary caretaker (through the Household Questionnaire) is essential, since he or she is a source of valuable information on these motherless children.

The household survey programme is the largest source of statistical information on children. \r\n\r\nBackground \r\n\r\nIn 1990, participants of the World Summit for Children adopted a set of goals to promote the welfare of children. At the same time, they recognized that many countries lacked the capacity to accurately measure progress toward these goals. UNICEF answered the call and developed MICS, which have been conducted every five years since 1995. Each round of surveys builds upon the last and offers new indicators to monitor current priorities in addition to monitoring trends. Since the initiation of the programme, nearly 200 surveys have been implemented in approximately 100 countries. The latest round of surveys (MICS3) is generating data representative of close to one in four children living in developing countries. \r\n\r\nMonitoring the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\n\r\nAlmost half of the MDG indicators are collected through MICS, making it one of the largest single sources of data for MDG monitoring. For MICS3, which began in 2005, UNICEF added several new indicators to track progress toward the MDGs and other major international commitments. \r\n\r\nContent \r\nMICS uses three modular questionnaires that can be customized to fit the data needs of a country. Together, they help measure key indicators on the following topics: \r\n- Nutrition: nutritional status, breastfeeding, salt iodization, vitamin A, low birth weight; \r\n- child mortality; child health: immunization, tetanus toxoid, care of illness, solid fuel use, malaria, source and cost of supplies; \r\n- environment: water and sanitation, security of tenure and durability of housing; \r\n- reproductive health: contraception and unmet need, maternal and newborn health, maternal mortality; \r\n- child development; \r\n- education: literacy; \r\n- child protection: birth registration, child labour, child discipline, early marriage and polygyny, female genital mutilation/cutting, domestic violence, disability and; \r\n- AIDS, sexual behaviour, and orphaned and vulnerable children: knowledge and attitudes, sexual behaviour, support to orphaned and vulnerable children. \r\n\r\nCoordination of Data Collection \r\n\r\nUNICEF makes every effort to harmonize MICS and the indicators measured with other similar household survey projects, in particular the USAID-supported Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) programme. This level of coordination ensures maximum coverage, analysis of trends over time, and comparability across projects while guaranteeing the acquisition of most of the indicators needed to monitor the situation of children and women locally and globally. \r\n\r\nImplementation and Capacity Building \r\n\r\nMICS are typically carried out by government organizations, with the technical support and financial assistance of UNICEF and its partners. UNICEF provides technical support and training through a series of regional workshops covering questionnaire content, sampling and survey implementation, data processing, data quality and data analysis, and report writing, data archiving, and dissemination.", "notes":"", "published":0, "weight":407},

Questions about current school attendance cover children and young adults aged 5 through 24 years. All countries should retain this age range. An age range of 5-14 years is set for the child labour indicators, but data may be collected for older children to accommodate country policies. \r\n\r\nFLOW OF THE HOUSEHOLD QUESTIONNAIRE: CORE, ADDITIONAL AND OPTIONAL MODULES \r\n\r\nThe Household Questionnaire consists of seven core modules. All of these core modules can be completed with a knowledgeable adult household member (referred to as the main respondent for sake of convenience), with the exception of the Child Labour module, which has to be completed with the mothers or primary caretakers of children eligible for inclusion in the module. \r\n\r\nThe Household Questionnaire begins with a cover page, the Household Information Panel, which includes information on the household and should be completed for all sampled households, including those where the interview was not completed. \r\n\r\nThis is followed by the Household Listing, used to collect information on all usual residents of the household, including their age, sex, relationship to the household head as well as questions on orphanhood. This module can be completed with the main respondent, although it is useful if the main respondent is also the mother or primary caretaker of children. \r\n\r\nThe Education module includes questions on the educational attainment of household members who are 5 years of age or over, as well as school attendance for household members aged 5-24 years. \r\n\r\nThe subsequent two modules, Water and Sanitation and Household Characteristics, concern the household and the dwelling and should be completed in all households with the main respondent to the Household Questionnaire. \r\n\r\nCompletion of the next module, the Child Labour module, is to be carried out with the mothers or primary caretakers of children aged 5-14 years living in the household. \r\n\r\nThe Household Questionnaire ends with a module on Salt Iodization, where the result of salt testing is to be recorded. Salt testing is carried out in all households in the sample. \r\n\r\nThree additional modules have been designed for inclusion on the Household Questionnaire. Two of these modules, the Extended Household Listing and the Children Orphaned and Made Vulnerable by HIV/AIDS should be included together, since the former includes questions that determine eligibility for the latter. The Extended Household Listing is designed to replace the Household Listing module. \r\n\r\nThe module on Children Orphaned and Made Vulnerable by AIDS is added on to the Household Questionnaire as a separate module and is administered to the main respondent to the Household Questionnaire, collecting information on children aged 0-17 years. \r\n\r\nIn malaria-endemic countries, the module on Insecticide-Treated Nets is to be included as a separate module, and is administered to the main respondent. \r\n\r\nThe first of six optional modules in the Household Questionnaire, Additional Household Characteristics, consists of questions that should be added on to the core Household Characteristics module. The module on Security of Tenure and Durability of Housing is administered in households in urban areas that have large proportions of slum households, and is added to the end of the Household Characteristics module (or to the additional Household Characteristics module, if that is included). The questions included in the module on Source and Cost of Supplies for Insecticide-Treated Mosquito Nets should be inserted in the Insecticide- Treated Nets module, and should be administered in all households. The optional modules on Child Discipline and Disability are administered to the mothers or primary caretakers of children eligible for these modules, those aged 2-14 years and 2-9 years, respectively. The final optional module on Maternal Mortality targets all household members aged 15 and over. The module is designed to allow for each of these respondents to answer the questions, but also allows for proxy responses from other adult household members.", "notes":"", "published":0, "weight":408},

The questionnaire covers some very sensitive topics, and only female interviewers should be used. Special precautions should be taken to guard the confidentiality of women\u2019s responses. \r\n\r\nThe women\u2019s modules measure indicators of contraceptive use (an MDG indicator); access to skilled attendants at delivery (an MDG indicator); incidence of low birthweight (a World Fit for Children goal); post-partum vitamin A supplementation (a World Fit for Children goal); and tetanus toxoid coverage of infants (a World Summit for Children goal). Knowledge of HIV/AIDS is also obtained in a separate module (an MDG indicator). \r\n\r\nQuestions to measure under-five and infant mortality rates (both MDG indicators) are also included in the Women\u2019s Questionnaire. \r\n\r\nAn additional module of questions relevant to HIV prevention programmes is included to monitor changes in young women\u2019s sexual behaviour (an MDG indicator). This module is administered only to women 15-24 years of age and should be included in the core questionnaire where possible. \r\n\r\nQuestions concerning sexual behaviour are sensitive in all countries and require skilled interviewers to administer these modules appropriately. Some survey coordinators may decide that the interviewer\u2019s training is not sufficient to address these sensitive issues. Survey coordinators and the MICS3 national steering committees must make the final decision about inclusion of this module. \r\n\r\nFLOW OF THE WOMEN\u2019S QUESTIONNAIRE: CORE, ADDITIONAL AND OPTIONAL MODULES \r\n\r\nThe Questionnaire for Individual Women is administered to all women aged 15-49 years, and consists of seven core modules. All modules in this questionnaire, including the additional and optional modules, are to be completed with a single respondent - the eligible woman. Under no circumstances should a proxy respondent be allowed to respond on behalf of the woman herself. \r\n\r\nSome countries may decide to administer this questionnaire to evermarried women only. In some settings, topics such as contraceptive use or sexual behaviour may be considered inappropriate for women who have never been married for cultural reasons, or the incidence of sexual activity or contraceptive use may be negligible. In such cases, it is possible to collect information on the marital status of women in the Household Listing of the Household Questionnaire and modify the eligibility for the women\u2019s questionnaire to \u2018all women aged 15-49 years who have ever been married\u2019. This is not recommended, however, since it introduces a new dimension to the identification of eligible woman, makes analysis more difficult, and relies heavily on the responses from the main respondent to the Household Questionnaire for the identification of the respondent. For these reasons, it is preferable to retain the eligibility criteria used in the model questionnaires, but to obtain information on the marital status of the woman in the Questionnaire for Individual Women and use this information to skip questions or modules that may be considered inappropriate. On the other hand, it is worthwhile to mention that, in many settings, never-married respondents are less reluctant to answer sensitive questions than survey administrators think they are. We therefore recommend that a thorough evaluation concerning the applicability of the questions be carried out and perhaps tested during the pre-test exercise, before a decision is made. \r\n\r\nThe Questionnaire for Individual Women begins with the Woman\u2019s Information Panel, which includes identification codes for the woman, as well as questions on age, date of birth and literacy. \r\n\r\nThe module on Child Mortality is used to collect information useful for estimating infant and under-five mortality rates, as well as information on the timing of women\u2019s last birth, if any. This latter information is used to determine whether the woman should respond to questions in the subsequent two modules, on Tetanus Toxoid and Maternal and Newborn Health, which are applied to all women with a live birth within the 2 years preceding the interview. \r\n\r\nFollowing this are three modules administered to all women: Marriage/Union, Contraception and HIV/AIDS. \r\n\r\nFour additional modules have been designed for the Questionnaire for Individual Women. For malaria-endemic countries, the Maternal and Newborn Health module has been expanded to include questions on intermittent preventive treatment for pregnant women. This additional module should be used to replace the Maternal and Newborn Health module in the core questionnaire. In countries where polygyny is practiced, the Marriage/Union with Polygyny module should be used to replace the Marriage/Union module. In affected countries, the Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting module should be added to the women\u2019s questionnaire as a separate module. The module on Sexual Behaviour is only applicable to women aged 15-24 years and should be added immediately prior to the HIV/AIDS module. The inclusion of the module is advocated in countries where HIV infection rates are high. Three optional modules have been designed for inclusion in the women\u2019s questionnaire. Of these, the modules on Security of Tenure and Attitudes Towards Domestic Violence should be added to the questionnaire as separate modules. The module on Contraception and Unmet Need, if included, replaces the Contraception module.", "notes":"", "published":0, "weight":409},

Such children usually constitute a more vulnerable group and it is important to obtain information on them. \r\n\r\nIn many other similar surveys, such as the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), information on children under five is normally collected only if the mother is interviewed. Identification of a primary caretaker (through the Household Questionnaire) is essential, since he or she is a source of valuable information on these motherless children.

This hierarchy is intended as rough guidance for questionnaire designers trying to decide which education modules to include in their questionnaire.\r\nEPDC organized the modules into three categories:\r\n\r\nCORE MODULES\r\n\r\nWe strongly recommend that these four modules \u2013 Learning, Attainment, Participation, and Efficiency \u2013 be included in all household surveys. The core modules have an elegant design that makes it possible to calculate a large number of internationally relevant indicators using a relatively small number of questions. Learning, Attainment, and Participation modules are highlighted by the United Nations as core topics for censuses. \r\n\r\nThough efficiency topics are not highlighted by the UN, we believe they should be considered a core topic for household surveys because of the large number of internationally-monitored indicators that can be calculated when our recommended efficiency module is included. The indicators produced provide a fundamental understanding of the formal education situation in a country. The core modules are consistent with a number of past DHS and MICS surveys, and would build on a body of data that is relatively comparable over time and across countries.\r\n\r\nIt is highly recommended that the four education modules listed in this section \u2013 Learning, Educational Attainment, School Participation, and Educational Efficiency \u2013 be treated as a core set of education questions that should be included in every household survey questionnaire. The simple structure of these questions reduces the likelihood of errors or misunderstanding during the interview process, and taken as a whole, the questions included in these modules are an elegant and efficient way to gather the information needed to calculate more than half of the indicators recommended through this report, many of which are indicators commonly used to track progress towards international goals education goals. Moreover, the education indicators generated through these modules are some of those that are most often used by national and international policymakers in the education policy realm.\r\n\r\nThere is strong precedence for the use of these questions in the education modules of well established lines household surveys: the exact wording is used in the widely used MICS and DHS questionnaires, and questions with closely similar wording can be found in the LSMS, CWIQ and other series. An advantage of this is that data gathered through this core module will be compatible with data collected through MICS and DHS, and to a lesser extent, LSMS and CWIQ. The core modules also serve as a foundation for the Auxiliary Modules suggested for use in household surveys.\r\n\r\nThe core modules are an excellent way to gather information on educational attainment, school participation, and educational efficiency as they relate to the formal education sector, but are not appropriate for gathering information relating to the non-formal learning activities. Definitions of formal, non-formal, and informal education can be found in the Educational Attainment module. Non-formal education is addressed in the Non Formal Education module.\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDED AUXILIARY MODULES\r\n\r\nWe recommend that these modules be included in every household survey if resources permit. These modules build on the core modules and address fundamental issues such as reasons for non-attendance among school-aged children, and the household financial burden of sending a child to school. These modules are not foundational in the same way that the core modules are but are of great potential interest to education policymakers because they build an understanding of the social and economic forces driving the literacy, attainment, attendance, and efficiency indicators measured through the core modules.\r\n\r\nOPTIONAL AUXILIARY MODULES\r\n\r\nThese modules may or may not be of interest to policymakers depending on the policy priorities of the country where the survey takes place.

The rationale for including these particular questions is based on the review of the key policy issues that household data can inform and an assessment of the feasibility of including such questions in LSMS surveys. The format of the proposed modules is similar to that often used in current LSMS surveys in order to facilitate their adoption.\r\n\r\nFormulation of the questions presented in the prototype modules draws on experience from recent LSMS and specialized household energy surveys. The notes provided point out commonly encountered problems and how they may be overcome. The notes caution that the questions must be customized to the particular country for which a survey is designed, taking into account its unique circumstances of fuel and electricity availability and use.\r\n\r\nThe prototype modules presented below have been designed for insertion in an LSMS survey as stand-alone modules. Since the questions in each prototype module complement each other, their potential to yield the greatest amount of data on household energy use will be realized if they are kept whole. However, because of the necessity to limit the number of modules, LSMS survey designers may not always be able to insert stand-alone modules. Instead, the electricity and fuels questions on access, consumption, prices, costs, and end use in the prototype modules may be integrated into another module, such as the Housing Module, and questions on time spent collecting fuels into the Time Use and Labor Module.\r\n\r\nQuestions in the Durable Goods (Light Bulbs and Appliances) Module may be integrated into the LSMS Durable Goods Module.

An important step towards resolving this global crisis is to understand its magnitude: how many people lack access to drinking-water and sanitation?\r\n\r\nTo help answer this question, household surveys and censuses are conducted every year throughout the world to assess drinking-water, sanitation, and hygiene-related practices at the household level. Because of variations in survey tools, attempts to compare the results of one survey with those of another have been fraught with diffi culties. Solving survey comparability problems is crucial if we are to establish accurate trends over time within a country, and compare data between countries.\r\n\r\nFor this reason, the WHO/UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation developed a set of harmonized survey questions that helps to resolve the comparability problems of the past. Including the harmonized questions in national surveys and censuses will help countries gain more systematic information on the drinking-water and sanitation needs of their population. Used widely, these harmonized questions will make data across international and national survey programmes more comparable, which in turn will result in more accurate country, regional and global estimates of unmet drinking-water and sanitation needs. \r\n\r\nThe core harmonized questions presented in this guide have been adopted by the Demographic and Health Surveys, the Multiple Indicator Cluster Survey, and the World Health Survey. The purpose of this guide is to encourage more widespread use of these harmonized questions, because accurate information is a valuable tool that can be used to assess progress towards international and national goals and targets.

TALIS offers an opportunity for teachers and school principals to give their input into education analysis and policy development in some key policy areas. Cross-country analysis from TALIS allows countries to identify other countries facing similar challenges and to learn from other policy approaches. The first TALIS survey has been conducted in 24 countries across four continents, and future rounds of TALIS are planned.\r\n\r\nWho is surveyed in TALIS\r\n\r\nThe first round of TALIS surveyed teachers of lower secondary education and the principals of the schools in which they work. Separate questionnaires for teachers and principals were developed by an international expert group and were discussed throughout their development with teacher representative bodies, in particular the Trades Union Advisory Council (TUAC) at the OECD. Each questionnaire took about 45 minutes to complete. The TALIS survey could also be completed on line and the structure of the questionnaires was adapted for computer use.\r\n\r\nThe survey responses are entirely confidential and at no time are the names of individual teachers, principals or schools identified.\r\n\r\nWithin participating countries, schools as well as teachers within schools, were randomly selected to take part in TALIS.

MICS was a major source of data on the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) indicators and will continue to be a major data source during the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda to measure Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) indicators.\r\n \r\nThe information obtained through MICS surveys \u2013 on topics ranging from maternal and child health, education and child mortality to child protection, HIV/AIDS and water and sanitation \u2013 is fundamental to sound decision-making and advocacy. Countries also use MICS results to report on their progress towards international goals. For example, MICS has generated data on the majority of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) indicators that can be measured through household surveys. Data collected in the fifth and current round of MICS \u2013 MICS5 \u2013 has played a critical role in the final assessment of the MDGs in September 2015 and subsequent surveys in MICS6 will provide the baselines for the new Sustainable Development Goals.\r\n\r\nMICS surveys are designed to be representative. The average sample size in the 5th round is around 11,000 households, although it varies greatly from one survey to the other. Interviewers administer the household questionnaire as well as individual questionnaires to women and men aged 15 to 49 years and to mothers or caretakers of all children under 5 years of age. The number of topics covered has increased substantially over the years as demand for data has grown. In the 5th round, MICS is providing data on more than 130 internationally agreed-upon indicators.\r\n\r\nIn addition to collecting information on intervention coverage, MICS also explores knowledge of and attitudes to certain topics, and specific behaviors of women, men and children, enabling analysts to gain insights into behaviours that may affect women\u2019s and children\u2019s lives. MICS routinely disaggregates data so that disparities associated with age, gender, education, wealth, location of residence, ethnicity and other characteristics are revealed.", "notes":"", "published":0, "weight":0},
