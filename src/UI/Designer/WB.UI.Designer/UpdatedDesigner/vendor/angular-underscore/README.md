# An AngularJS module adapting underscore

This module exposes underscore's API into angular app's root scope,
and provides some filters from underscore.


## Filters

Whole Underscore's API for Collections, Arrays and Objects except decision API
(e.g. functions return true|false), side effect guys, and _.range(not making sense as a filter).


For API details please check out http://underscorejs.org/

## How to use

### Install

After load angular.js and underscore.js:

```html
<script type="text/javascript" src="angular-underscore.js"></script>
```

```
