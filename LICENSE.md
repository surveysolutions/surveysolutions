        ten (10) days notice given to Licensee pursuant to this

        identifies a uniform resource locator which contains the
        applicable license.

    3.  **No Further Restrictions.** Licensee shall not impose any
        restrictions on the further use, distribution or modification of
        Licensed Software, whether distributed by itself or as part of a
        Covered Work, provided that the License Software is made
        available by Licensee and its sublicensee on terms specified in

    4.  **Enforcement of Sublicenses.** By accepting this License
        Agreement and a copy of the Licensed Software, Licensee agrees
        that it will take action to enforce the terms of any
        sublicenses, including without limitation seeking injunctive or
        other equitable relief. Licensee shall not, however, name or

        Bank . No enforcement action shall be required if the World Bank
        is deemed a necessary party plaintiff or defendant and the World
        Bank withholds consent to being so named. In the event that

        conditions of the licenses granted in Article 2 Licensee

        hereunder, without further notice from World Bank. Sublicenses
        granted by Licensee in accordance with this Agreement shall
        continue in effect, provided that the applicable sublicensees
        comply and continue to comply with all provisions of Exhibit A
        hereto.

    6.  **Permitted Arrangements.** Nothing herein shall prohibit
        Licensee (or any sublicensee) from offering and charging for
        warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligations to one or
        more recipients of Licensed Software or Covered Works, provided
        that Licensee and any applicable sublicensee prominently
        notifies any persons purchasing such additional obligations that
        such obligations are solely the obligations of the persons
        offering such obligations neither World Bank nor any person
